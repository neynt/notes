# SE 465: Software Testing and Quality Assurance

Professor: Patrick Lam

## Code gone wild

Software usually goes wrong and there are ways to make it go wrong less and go less wrong.

- **Validation** is ensuring that the code does the right thing.
- **Verification** is ensuring that the code conforms to the specs.
- **Faults** are static defects present in the software.
- An **error** is bad internal state caused by some fault.
- **Failures** are bad external behavior.

RIP fault model:
- **Reachable**: The fault must be reachable.
- **Infection**: The program state must be wrong after reaching the fault.
- **Propagate**: The infected state must propagate to output.

Dealing with faults:
- Avoid (e.g. use Rust)
- Detect (unit testing)
- Tolerate (redundancy, isolation, checking input)

Static vs. dynamic:
- **Static** techniques: Find fault directly by analyzing the program.
  - Examples: type checking, dead code analysis, null check, bounds check, code review, formal verification.
- **Dynamic** techniques: Observe failures by running the program with particular inputs and comparing them to expected.
  - Pros: It is easy to run the program
  - Cons: We need to generate inputs, and test suites can grow unnecessarily large

Words Patrick Lam does not like:
  - "Complete testing", "exhaustive testing"
    - No way. Input space is too big.
  - "Full coverage"
    - Of what? Lines? Branches?

You should stop testing when:
  - You run out of time (open-ended exploratory testing, automatic input generation)
  - You've explored "enough" of the behaviors, use cases, program states, inputs, and statements/branches

Controllability and observability are also things.

A **test requirement** (TR) is an element of an artifact that some test case must satisfy. For example,

- You might have a TR for every branch direction in a program.
- You might have a TR for every method in a class.
