# SE 465: Software Testing and Quality Assurance

Professor: Patrick Lam

## Code gone wild

Software usually goes wrong and there are ways to make it go wrong less and go less wrong.

- **Validation** is ensuring that the code does the right thing.
- **Verification** is ensuring that the code conforms to the specs.
- **Faults** are static defects present in the software.
- An **error** is bad internal state caused by some fault.
- **Failures** are bad external behavior.

RIP fault model:
- **Reachable**: The fault must be reachable.
- **Infection**: The program state must be wrong after reaching the fault.
- **Propagate**: The infected state must propagate to output.

Dealing with faults:
- Avoid (e.g. use Rust)
- Detect (unit testing)
- Tolerate (redundancy, isolation, checking input)
