# PHYS 234: Quantum Physics 1

Professor: Qing-Bin Lu

## Background / History

### Equations

* Wien's empirical formula: $$ u(v)dv = c_1 v^3 e^{-c_2 v / T} dv $$
* Rayleigh-Jeans: $$ u(v)dv = \frac{8\pi}{c^3} k T v^2 dv $$
* Planck's good formula: $$ u(v)dv = c_1 v^3 (e^{-c_2 v / T} - 1) dv $$
* Planck-Einstein relation: $$ E = hv $$, $$ p = E / c = h / \lambda $$
* Light intensity: $$ I = nhv $$
* Work function of metal / ionization energy of gas: $$ hv \geq \Phi $$
* Maximum kinetic energy of emitted electrons: $$ hv - \Phi $$

### By topic

* Blackbody radiation: Wien's empirical formula only worked for high frequency, Rayleigh-Jeans only worked for low frequency (ultraviolet catastrophe). Planck's worked for all frequencies and was explained by energy quanta.
* Photoelectric effect: Hertz noticed sparks from metals. Lenard noticed that gases did this too. Einstein explained this using light quanta.
* Solid heat capacity: Einstein explained using energy quanta.
* Atomic spectra: Hydrogen emits in several series. Lyman, Balmer, Paschen are first three. Balmer's formula is miraculous.
* Atomic model: Thomson came up with plum pudding. Rutherford disproves with gold foil / \alpha scattering experiment, comes up with planetary model. Bohr extends this model to be very good.

### By person 
* Heinrich Hertz: Initially observed photoelectric effect.
* Wien: Did an empirical formula for blackbody radiation.
* JJ Thompson: Discovered the electron. Plum pudding model.
* Philipp Lenard: Gases also emit electrons
* Rayleigh-Jeans: Did a bad EM-theory based formula for blackbody radiation.
* Kelvin: Two dark clouds
* Einstein: Photoelectric effect, solid heat capacity, and more!
* Millikan: Oil drop experiment, cosmic rays
* Bohr: Model of atom, orbitals.
* Balmer: Four hydrogen lines formula
* Rutherford: Gold foil experiment
* Pauli: Exclusion principle
* Heisenberg: Matrix mechanics
* Schrödinger: Wave mechanics

### Michelson-Morley experiment

Failed to measure any movement relative to the "luminiferous aether".

### Photoelectric effect

Einstein proposed **light quanta** to explain the photoelectric effect. He later used energy quanta to explain the heat capacity of solids.

## De Broglie's matter wave

De Broglie extended Einstein's equation,

$$
p = \frac{h}{\lambda}
$$

from photons to electrons, ions, and all other particles. Einstein said that this was "the first feeble ray of light on the worst of our physics enigmas".

## The Schrödinger Equation

$$
i \hbar \frac{\partial \Psi(x,t)}{\partial t} = \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V \right] \Psi(x,t)
$$

This is the $$F=ma$$ of quantum.
