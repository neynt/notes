## History

A while back, physics had some problems which they solved.

Problems were solved like so:

- Blackbody radiation: Planck's energy quanta
- Photoelectric effect: Einstein's light quanta
- Heat capacity of solids: Einstein's model of solids
- Bright line optical spectra: Bohr's model of the atom

### Michelson-Morley experiment

The **Michelson-Morley experiment** failed to measure any movement relative to the "luminiferous aether".

### Blackbody radiation

Classical EM theory couldn't explain the distribution of light frequencies in blackbody radiation.

Wien's empirical approximation (1896) worked for only short wavelengths.

$$ u(v) dv = c_1 v^3 e^{-c_2 v} $$

Rayleigh-Jeans equation based on EM theory worked for only long wavelengths.

$$ u(v) dv = \frac{8 \pi}{c^2} k T v^2 dv $$

But Planck's empirical formula worked for **all** wavelengths! He fixed the ultraviolet catastrophe.

$$ u(v) dv = \over{c_1}{e^{câ‚‚v/T} - 1} v^3 dv $$

Planck explained this formula using **energy quanta** -- it can be derived if you assume that electromagnetic radiation with frequency $$\nu$$ can only be absorbed or emitted in energies of $$nh\nu$$.

### Photoelectric effect

Einstein proposed **light quanta** to explain the photoelectric effect. He later used energy quanta to explain the heat capacity of solids.
