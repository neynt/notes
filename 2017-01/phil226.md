# PHIL 226: Biomedical Ethics

Brian Orend

## Ethics, morality, and justice

- Ethics are how you should live your life.
- Morals are how you should treat others.
- Justice is how we should shape social institutions.

## Moral systems

This is a difficult moral dilemma, and we draw upon five schools of ethics to aid us in making a decision.

1. Virtue ethics

Virtue ethics was developed by Aristotle. It states that the ethical decision in any situation is one that shows virtue, or excellence of character. In particular, Aristotle believed that there were four cardinal virtues that could form the basis for most ethical judgements: Prudence, temperance, courage, and justice.

In order to apply virtue ethics to this case, we must ask, "would ___ show that the doctor is virtuous?" In this case, the answer is emphatical "no". A virtuous person would not ___.

2. Duty-based ethics

Duty-based ethics were developed by Kant, and it was based on this one fundamental idea: that there is a fixed set of rules, or duties, inherent within all of us, and that the ethical action is the one that best follows this set of duties. For example, we all have a duty to tell the truth, and to help the needy.

In this case, ...

3. Utilitarianism

Utilitarianism is a school of ethics that takes a different approach.

4. Rights-based ethics

Does this violate the rights of ...?

5. Feminist ethics

Feminist ethics was created as a response to the other four ethical systems. 

- Virtue ethics (Teleology)
  - By Aristotle.
  - "What does a virtuous person do?"
  - A type of consequentialism
- Duty-based ethics (Deontology)
  - By Kant.
  - We all have a fixed set of duties deep inside us. The moral action is to follow these duties.
  - "Follow the rules deep within you and everyone else. Also, don't use people."
- Utilitarianism
  - By Jeremy Bentham.
  - A kind of consequentialism. (actions judged based on outcomes)
  - Utility is net pleasure minus pain
  - Moral act maximizes utility
  - Felicific / Hedonistic Calculus:
    - Intensity, Duration, Certainty, Propinquity (soonness), Fecundity (generation of other pleasures), Purity (not followed by pain), Extent.
  - Cons:
    - Other things are vital for human goodness.
    - Ends justifying the means.
    - Does not take intent into account
    - Nozick's "Pleasure Machine", "Utility Monsters"
    - Excessive self-sacrifice
  - Rule utilitarianism: General types of actions are judged
  - Act utilitarianism: Individual acts are judged
- Rights-based ethics
  - By John Locke
  - People have rights which must be respected
  - Negative rights (others should not do this), positive rights (others should do this)
  - Three generations of rights:
    - 1st generation: life, personal security, property, personal freedom, voting
    - 2nd generation: money, education, health care
  - Cons:
    - Sets bar too low
- Feminist ethics
  - (old) By Mary Wollestonecroft, Olympe de Gouge
  - (new) By Carol Gilligan
  - "What would a good mother do?"
  - Other theories are men-biased.
    - Virtue ethics: Aristotle was a chauvinist. Role model is MALE-PHILOSOPHER-WARRIOR.
    - Deontology:
      - Religious kind: God is a male metaphysics.
      - Secular kind: Excess rationality. Legalistic. Unemotional.
    - Utilitarianism: Excess rationality. Crude and visceral. Calculating.
    - Rights-based: Selfish. Unemotional. Minimizes constraints and obligations.
    - Also, all main figures are male.
  - Carol Gilligan's "In a Different Voice"
    - Women think better than men when it comes ot ethics, morality, justice
    - Men are:
      - Selfish
      - Untrusting
      - Abstract
      - Universal
      - Rational (unemotional)
      - Wish to transcend reality
    - Women are:
      - Other-oriented
      - Trusting
      - Concrete
      - Emotional
      - Realistic
      - Relational databases representing social graphs
  - Pros:
    - Diagnoses biases, shortcomings in other theories
    - Quite true
    - Good fit for medicine
  - Cons:
    - Stereotyping, unfair comparisons
    - Individuality vs. group membership
    - Vague
  

## Applying ethics to doctor-patient relationships

### Michael Bayle's models

1. **Agency model**. The professional is a "hired gun". The client has all the power. The professional's responsibility is to carry out the will of the client.
  - Bad.
  - Transactional.
  - Usually, the professional knows more about what the client wants
2. **Contract model**. Equal power between professional and client. Need consensus for decisions.
  - Still not good. 
  - Professional still knows more.
  - Sometimes, consensus not possible. Client can't consent. (e.g. ER)
3. **Paternalism**. Professional has all power and authority. "Doctor knows best."
  - Good, but...
  - Abuse of power possible
  - Wrong to leave client powerless.
4. **Fiduciary model**. Professional has more power, not authority.
  - Trust-based.
  - Clients' duties to the professional: pay them, be honest, don't ask them to do something illegal or unethical.
  - "Informed consent"
  - Pellegrino and Thomasma: The doctor should take control.

Goals of treatment
- Restore to normal functioning
- Manage
- Palliative care until death

Informed consent
- Informed: Therapeutic privilege: privilege of doctors to not tell the whole truth. Generally not a thing. Someone needs to know the truth.
- Consent: Patient is competent and able to make decisions. Age of majority, not coerced, and conscious. OR: Advance directive. Substitute decision-maker.

- Leukemia
- Had religious vision. Rejected chemotherapy and pursued aboriginal medicine.
- Died.

Trolley problem connection
- Refusal to take life-saving treatment is okay to humor. Request for harmful treatment is not okay.

Medical code of ethics
1. Do no harm (Non-maleficence)
2. Act in the patient's best interests (Beneficence)
3. Competence, non-impairment
4. Diligence, thoroughness
5. Honesty, full disclosure
6. Confidentiality, trustworthiness
7. No conflicts of interest.
8. Advance the profession.
9. Protect society and public health.
etc.

(Substance abuse story.)

**Conflicts of interest** are internal conflicts between duty and self-interest. Solutions: a.) disclose and obtain consent of those affected. b.) never have them.

True story: Dr. X surgery rescheduled to to Dr. Y. Dr. X's practice permanently closed. Had an affair with a patient. A woman scorned; reported him.

> When is it okay to date one of my patients?

True story: First girlfriend married American doctor. Doctor became druggie. Girlfriend leaves; doctor loses everything, license stripped and all. That's all folks. Salty.

**Negligence** is a thing in civil law. It consists of:
- failure to act as a reasonable practicioner (what would the average doctor do?)
- or violates a duty of care
- all leading to harm

Types of law:
- Public / criminal
- Private / civil

True story: Woke up in the middle of surgery, bolted straight up. Held right down by medical team.

Movie: Tuskegee syphilis study.

Jeremy Bentham monologue: Atheist. University College. Panopticon. Animal rights. Gender equality. Microeconomics. He's preserved in University College.

Kant vs. Bentham on exam.

Equipoise: Be neutral. Let data guide you, not the other way around.

Medical testing:
1. Toxicity testing. Find highest possible dose.
2. Optimization.
3. Large test population. Success -> go to market!
4. After-market. Keep track of side-effects.

The Pill
- Documentary about the birth control pill. Sexual liberation. Gregory Pincus supported by Margaret Sanger, John Rock.

Today's standards: medical experiments require:
- Voluntary informed consent of all subjects
- Realistic good consequences
- No exploitation or discrimination
- Privacy, confidentiality
- Oversight of an ethics research board

UChicago: 93% of research subjects "understood", 33% understood.

        - Allow inequalities, as long as they benefit everyone. --> Progressive tax, welfare state
