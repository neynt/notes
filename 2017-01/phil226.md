# PHIL 226: Biomedical Ethics

Brian Orend

## Background

- Ethics are how you should live your life.
- Morals are how you should treat others.
- Justice is how we should shape social institutions.

## Moral systems

### Value ethics (Teleology)

By Aristotle. "What does a virtuous person do?"

### Duty-based ethics (Deontology)

By Kant. "Just follow rules and don't use people."

### Utilitarianism

## Applying ethics to doctor-patient relationships

### Michael Bayle's models

1. **Agency model**. The professional is a "hired gun". The client has all the power. The professional's responsibility is to carry out the will of the client.
  - Bad.
  - Transactional.
  - Usually, the professional knows more about what the client wants
2. **Contract model**. Equal power between professional and client. Need consensus for decisions.
  - Still not good. 
  - Professional still knows more.
  - Sometimes, consensus not possible. Client can't consent. (e.g. ER)
3. **Paternalism**. Professional has all power and authority. "Doctor knows best."
  - Good, but...
  - Abuse of power possible
  - Wrong to leave client powerless.
4. **Fiduciary model**. Professional has more power, not authority.
  - Trust-based.
  - Clients' duties to the professional: pay them, be honest, don't ask them to do something illegal or unethical.
  - "Informed consent"
  - Pellegrino and Thomasma: The doctor should take control.

Goals of treatment
- Restore to normal functioning
- Manage
- Palliative care until death

Informed consent
- Informed: Therapeutic privilege: privilege of doctors to not tell the whole truth. Generally not a thing. Someone needs to know the truth.
- Consent: Patient is competent and able to make decisions. Age of majority, not coerced, and conscious. OR: Advance directive. Substitute decision-maker.

Trolley problem connection
- Refusal to take life-saving treatment is okay to humor. Request for harmful treatment is not okay.

**Conflicts of interest** are internal conflicts between duty and self-interest. Solutions: a.) disclose and obtain consent of those affected. b.) never have them.
