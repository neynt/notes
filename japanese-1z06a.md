# JAPANESE 1Z06A: Beginner's Intensive Japanese

Professor: Sonomi Iwata-Consul.

## Lecture 1 (2018 Sep 04)

- Missed lecture; notes reconstructed from online materials.

- Japanese has three writing systems: hiragana, katakana, and kanji.
  - Hiragana is cute and curvy and is used for grammar and words where the
    kanji is too hard.
  - Katakana is sharp and angly and is used to transcribe foreign words.
  - Kanji is Chinese and is used to make meaning clearer.

- TODO: Memorize the hiragana. No need for wi and we; they are not used.

- The dakuten (voicing mark) can be added to certain hiragana and katakana. It
  looks like two ticks, and it makes the consonant voiced. These are all the
  sounds it changes:
  - k→g. e.g. か (ka) → が (ga)
  - s→z. e.g. さ (sa) → ざ (za)
  - sh→j. e.g. し (shi) → じ (ji)
  - t→d. e.g. た (ta) → だ (da)
  - h→b. e.g. は (ha) → ば (ba)

- The handakuten (half-voicing mark), which is a small circle, makes the
  consonant half-voiced. It is only used to make turn the h- consonant into a
  p-.
  - h→p. e.g. は (ha) → ぱ (pa)

- Small versions of や, ゆ, and よ are used to replace the vowel of the
  preceding hiragana. e.g.:
  - きや → きゃ (kya)
  - きゆ → きゅ (kyu)
  - きよ → きょ (kyo)

- A small つ adds a small pause in the middle of a word.
  - きて (kite) → きって (kitte)
  - Find audio and listen to examples to understand this

- Japanese is quite rhythmic and is moraic rather than syllabic. Every kana
  typically represents the same amount of time, called a mora. A foot is two
  moras. This means you should be able to speak to a (very fast) metronome, and
  it should tick exactly once every time you say a kana.

- TODO: Memorize the numbers from 0 to 10. Know how to say numbers up to 12.

- Grammar 1: "is"
  - XはYです means "X is Y". Literally, "as for X, it is Y".
  - は is the topic particle; it marks the preceding word as the topic of the
    sentence.
  - です links the Y to the X. Formally it is a "copula", but no one actually
    knows what a copula is.

- Grammar 2: Questions
  - Adding か to the end of a sentence makes it a question.
  - You can also use 何 (なに or なん) to ask about a particular thing.

- Grammar 3: の
  - Put this between two nouns to make the first noun modify the second noun.
  - This is similar to "'s" in English, or 的 in Chinese.

    - 私 (わたし): I, me
    - あなた: You (not often used)

## Lecture 2 (2018 Sep 11)

- Missed lecture; notes reconstructed from online materials.

- TODO: Practice transcribing English words to Japanese. Check out "Rules for
  transcribing Katakana.pdf"

- Kosoado words
  - These describe the distance of things and also give you three question
    words.
  - Combine a Part 1 and a Part 2.
    - Part 1 determines distance.
    - Part 2 determines the kind of word you get.
  - Part 1s: こ (close by), そ (that), あ (far away), ど (which)
  - Part 2s: れ (thing), こ (place), の (adjective)
  - Exception: A far away place is あそこ, not あこ.
  - Examples:
    - これ is a "close by" "thing", i.e. "this".
    - そこ is "that" "place", i.e. "there".
    - どこ is "which" "place", i.e. "where".
  - See こそあどことば.pdf.

- Grammar 4: Whose
  - だれのXですか means "whose X is this?"
  - This isn't really a completely new point of grammar; just combines word 誰
    (だれ) with particle の.

- Grammar 5: Also
  - Replace は with も to add a sense of "also" to the sentence.
  - e.g. XはYです is "X is Y" → XもYです is "X is also Y"

- Grammar 6: Not
  - Xじゃない means "not X".
  - Xじゃありません is the same but politer.
  - Xではありません is the same for formal writing.

- Grammar 7: ね and よ
  - ね at the end of a sentence is like "right?". It makes you seek agreement.
  - よ at the end of a sentence makes it more authoritative, e.g. if you're
    telling someone something new.

- Vocabulary
  - Large numbers
    - 百 (ひゃく): 100
    - 千 (せん): 1,000
    - 万 (まん): 10,000
    - 十万: 100,000
    - 百万: 1,000,000
