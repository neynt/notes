Notes on An Introduction to Tonal Theory by Peter Westergaard.

## 2. Notes

### Intervals

- A second is the distance between adjacent notes in a diatonic collection. Major is 2 semitones; minor is 1 semitone
- nth intervals can be constructed as n-1 adjacent diatonic seconds.
- Table of intervals:
  - 2nd: maj (2), min (1)
  - 3rd: maj (4), min (3), dim (2)
  - 4th: prf (5), aug (6), dim (4)
  - 5th: prf (7), dim (6), aug (8)
    - Note: dim 5th is possible within a diatonic collection
  - 6th: maj (9), min (8), aug (10)
  - 7th: maj (11), min (10), dim (9)
  - 8ve: prf (12)
- Table of names for semitone counts:
  - 1: min2
  - 2: maj2¸ dim3
  - 3: min3
  - 4: maj3, dim4
  - 5: prf4
  - 6: aug4, dim5
  - 7: prf5
  - 8: aug5, min6
  - 9: maj6, dim7
  - 10: aug6, min7
  - 11: maj7
  - 12: prf8

### Time

- bpm scale:
  - 30 is too slow
  - 42 is very slow
  - 60 is moderately slow
  - 84 is moderate
  - 120 is moderately fast
  - 168 is very fast
  - 240 is too fast
  - these correspond to half powers of two times 60

## 3. Lines

- A line is a chain of consecutive notes.

- 3.1. Repetitions, skips, steps:
  - Repetition: unison (0 semitones)
  - Step: maj2 or min2 (1-2 semitones)
  - Skip: ≥3 semitones

- 3.2. Consonance and dissonance
  - Things that are consonant:
    - Perfect unisons (0 semitones)
    - Perfect octaves (12 semitones)
    - Perfect fifths (7 semitones)
    - Perfect fourths *where there's some other note below the fourth!!* (5 semitones)
    - Major and minor thirds (3-4 semitones)
    - Major and minor sixths (8-9 semitones)
  - Things that are dissonant:
    - Non-consonant perfect fourths
    - Major and minor seconds (1-2 semitones)
    - Major and minor sevenths (10-11 semitones)
    - Augmented and diminished (all)

- 3.3. Line operations and constructs
  - Rearticulation
    - Split note at some point.
    - In general, when note is repeated, must think about which has conceptual
      priority (Elongation or anticipation?)
  - Neighbor embellishment
    - Take a rearticulation, rearticulate the first note again, and shift the
      second note to an adjacent diatonic pitch.
    - Surrounding notes have priority over the neighbor
    - If neighbor is not in diatonic collection:
      - Minor second away: It's just an intensifier bro
      - Major second away: Must consider a different diatonic collection
  - Arpeggiation
    - Two-note chord becomes line
    - No note has priority
    - The chord has priority over the line
    - Anticipatory arpeggiation: Preceding note makes way for subsequent
      arpeggiation's first note. (uh yeah okay guy)
  - Step motion
    - Take an arpeggiation and use the later part of the first note to
      interpolate to the second note in some diatonic collection
    - If pitches don't belong to diatonic collection:
      - Final step minor second: It's just INTENSITY, bro
      - Minor second elsewhere: Reframe in different diatonic collection
  - Delay
    - Begin note later.
    - Either previous note extended or rest added.
    - Can also turn into step motion because lol rigor
  - Using these transformations, we can convert back and forth between chord
    progressions and complex melodies. e.g. neighbors are nonchord tones,
    intermediate chords are step motions from start and goal chords

- Exercises: how bout I don't?

- 3.4. Triads, tonic, and diatonic degrees
  - Triad
    - Generate a triad by picking three pitch classes that are pairwise
      consonant. Six possibilities if one note is fixed.
    - Every triad has a major third and minor third.
    - Color:
      - Major triad: Root then major third (3) then minor third (7).
      - Minor triad: Root then minor third (4) then major third (7).
  - Notes in a key
    - In the key of X, X is the tonic.
    - dominant = tonic + fifth.
    - mediant = tonic + third.
    - tonic triad = tonic + dominant + mediant.
    - If tonic triad is major, the key is major.
    - If tonic triad is minor, the key is minor.
    - Planetary model of the scale where you add all the fifths from a triad
      - Ah yes but seventh degree is neighbor to tonic so raise it a semitone,
        except when you use 6 as neighbor to 5 upward, where you need unaltered
        7th to do step motion

- Exercises: hahahah

- 3.5. Tonal pitch structures
  - Basic underlying structure of all tonal pieces:
    - Bass is 1-5-1 or 1-3-5-1
    - Upper line has descending step motion from triad pitch to tonic
