\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
People face tradeoffs
\series default
.
 Society in particular must trade off 
\series bold
efficiency
\series default
 (producing as much as possible) and 
\series bold
equity
\series default
 (dividing it in a fair way).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Cost is what you give up to get something
\series default
.
 We call this 
\series bold
opportunity cost
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

 to maximize shareholder value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Governments can improve market outcomes
\series default
.
 By enforcing property rights, or by promoting efficiency or equity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
A country's standard of living depends on how much it produces
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Prices rise when the government prints too much money
\series default
.
 This is called inflation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Society faces a short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment
\series default

The 
\series bold
production possibilities frontier
\series default
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 shows the possible production of combinations of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 It is never concave down.
 The 
\series bold
opportunity cost
\series default
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $-\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Production efficiency
\series default
 means that we are on the PPF.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Allocative efficiency
\series default
 means in addition that we produce the goods that provide the greatest possible
 benefit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
marginal cost
\series default
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is the slope of the PPF.
 The 
\series bold
marginal benefit
\series default

\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is the increase in utility from another 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, measured in 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\series bold
marginal benefit curve
\series default
 specifies marginal benefit and generally goes down (the 
\series bold
principle of decreasing marginal benefit
\series default
).
 At the point of allocative efficiency, the marginal cost and marginal benefit
 are equal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Economic growth

Comparative advantage
\series default
 means you can produce something at a lower opportunity cost.
 
\series bold
Absolute advantage

 means you produce more of everything.
 If everyone specializes in things they have a comparative advantage in
 and trade, everyone ends up better off.
\end_layout

GDP and economic growth (ch20)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold

 is the total market value of the final goods and services produced in a
 country in a time period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\series bold
final good
\series default
 is bought by its final user, whereas an 
\series bold
intermediate good
\series default
 is used to make another good.
 Intermediate goods aren't in GDP because that's double counting.
 Final/intermediate sometimes depends on context.
 Financial instruments and secondhand goods are not part of GDP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Gross
\series default
 means before subtracting depreciation (contrast with 
\series bold
net
\series default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Real GDP
\series default

\series bold
Nominal GDP
\series default
 is not real.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Real GDP per person
\series default
 is a useful metric.
 
\series bold
Potential GDP
\series default
 is the maximum real GDP that can be obtained without shortages of the factors
 of production (inflation comes with that).
 The 
\series bold
Lucas wedge
\series default
 is the area on a graph between these two GDPs over time; it illustrates
 the cost of a slowdown in productivity growth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To compare GDPs between different countries, can be more accurate to use

PPP
\series default
 (purchasing power parity) prices: calculate the second country's GDP using
 the same prices as those of the first.

\series bold
The income approach
\series default
:
\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset

where 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset


\series default
 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Business cycle
\end_layout

\series bold
expansion
\series default
 and 
\series bold
recession
\series default
 with turning points at the 
\series bold
peak
\series default
 and 
\series bold
trough
\series default

Things GDP misses out on
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Household production
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold

 environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Leisure time

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Composition and distribution of output
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Non-material source of well-being
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 rate overestimates the growth rate of total production (since some production
 replaces household production).

 growth rate between adjacent years, with each year's products measured
 at the other year's prices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Unemployment (ch21)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unemployment is a problem because it results in:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lost income and production â€” a person is not put to their full use, and
 also doesn't make money
\end_layout

The most costly unemployment comes from job loss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Unemployment cycles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Frictional unemployment
\series default
: Results from duration of job matching, people entering and leaving the
 labour force, and the creation/destruction of jobs.
 Exacerbated by better unemployment benefits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Structural unemployment
\series default
: Skill requirements or job locations change.
 Lasts longer than frictional.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Cyclical unemployment
\series default
: Business cycle is low.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Natural unemployment

\series bold
Full employment
\series default

 Most important factors that influence this are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Population age distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Scale of structural change
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Real wage rate

\series bold
efficiency wage
\series default
 (premium to retain talent) increase natural unemployment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Unemployment benefits: increase unemployment

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sources of bias in the CPI include:
\end_layout

: Arrival of better, more expensive things biases inflation upward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Commodity substitution bias
\series default
: When prices increase, people buy cheaper alternatives.
 CPI basket is not rebalanced, so the increase in prices is overstated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Outlet substitution bias
\series default
: When prices increase, people shop at cheaper stores.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bias is about 
\begin_inset Formula $+0.6$

% per year for Canada.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Other price indices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold

: trades government securities on the public market.
 Buying bonds increases, and selling bonds decreases, the money supply.

 Increasing this rate stops banks from creating too much money.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Changing reserve requirements.

\begin_layout Subsection
Creating money
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Banks create money by making loans.
 This created money is limited by the monetary base, and further limited

desired currency holding
\series default
.
 The

ratio
\series bold
 
\series default
is the ratio of currency to deposits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The banking system creates money as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The monetary base is increased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Bank reserves are increased, creating excess reserves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Banks lend out their excess reserves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The quantity of money increases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
New deposits are used to make payments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\begin_layout Enumerate
Banks have less excess reserves than before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 In Canada, the M1 multiplier is about 
\begin_inset Formula $8\pm2$
\end_inset

 and the M2 multiplier is about 
\begin_inset Formula $18\pm2$

velocity of circulation
\series default

\end_inset

 is the price level, 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 is the real GDP, and 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is the quantity of money.
 Expressing this in terms of rates gives us
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\text{Inflation rate}= & \phantom{+}\text{Money growth rate}\\

Aggregate supply
\series default
 is the relationship between real GDP supplied and the price level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Long run
\series default
: real GDP supplied = potential GDP because an increase in the price level

 Their beliefs:
\end_layout

 Turns out:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\text{induced expenditure} & =C-M\\
\text{autonomous expenditure} & =I+G+X

Planned expenditure is not necessarily actual expenditure, so 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 is maybe not equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $C+I+G+X-M$
\end_inset

 here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Equilibrium expenditure
\series default
 is when planned expenditure equals real GDP.
 When actual expenditure doesn't equal planned expenditure, they converge

\end_inset

It gives you how much GDP increases with a given investment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Expenditure vs.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When aggregate planned expenditure increases:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Aggregate expenditure shifts up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Aggregate demand shifts right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the short run:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Aggregate expenditure increases...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
But SAS doesn't change and the price level increases too...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So the increase in aggregate expenditure is a bit cancelled out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the long run:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Aggregate expenditure increases...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
But LAS stays the same, bringing the price level way up...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The business cycle, inflation, and deflation (ch28)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two business cycle theories: mainstream and real.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Mainstream business cycle theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This theory says that potential GDP grows at a steady rate, but aggregate
 demand grows at a fluctuating rate.
 If aggregate demand grows slower than potential GDP, then a lower-than-expected
 growth in aggregate demand creates a recessionary gap (other way: inflationary
 gap).
 There are a couple of variations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Keynesian cycle theory
\series default
: Aggregate demand fluctuates mainly because investment fluctuates, driven
 by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

animal spirits
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (confidence).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Monetarist cycle theory
\series default
: Aggregate demand fluctuates mainly because of investment and consumption
 expenditure fluctuate, mainly because the growth rate of the quantity of
 money fluctuates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
New classical cycle theory
\series default
: Money wage rate and SAS are determined by potential GDP and 
\emph on
expected
\emph default
 aggregate demand.
 So only 
\emph on
unexpected
\emph default
 fluctuations in aggregate demand do things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
New Keynesian cycle theory
\series default
: Money wage rate and SAS were negotiated in the past, so they were determined
 by past rational expectations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Real business cycle theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This theory says that productivity fluctuates because of technological change,
 international disturbances, climate, and natural disasters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Impulses
\series default
 are generated by technology.
 Technology that makes existing capital obsolete temporarily decrease productivi
ty â€” in the loanable funds market, DLF shifts left because firms purchase
 less, and in the labour market, the supply and demand for labour both fall,
 but demand falls more, so the real wage rate falls.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
RBC theorists also believe that a higher interest rate makes people work
 more, so that they can have more money now.
 Many economists believe this intertemporal substitution effect is small,
 but RBC theorists think it's big.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Criticism of RBC theory include:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The money wage rate is clearly sticky.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Intertemporal substitution doesn't account for all the large fluctuations
 in labour supply.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Productivity shocks may be caused by changes in aggregate demand, not just
 technology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Standard defenses are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A single theory explains both growth and cycles.
 And it doesn't matter if assumptions are weird as long as the theory works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
RBC is consistent with microeconomic ideas about labour and investment decisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Inflation cycles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Demand-pull inflation
\series default
 is that which starts because aggregate demand increases (for any reason).
 The initial effect is AD shifting right.
 Then, the money wage rate rises and SAS shifts upward compensate, putting
 us back at LAS.
 If this happens repeatedly (e.g.
 via increasing the money supply), we get inflation.
 This happened in Canada in the late 1960s due to US and Canadian government
 spending.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Cost-push inflation
\series default
 is that which starts with costs increase, whether due to a higher money
 wage rate or a higher price for raw materials.
 This happened in Canada in the mid 1970s when OPEC quadrupled oil prices.
 It is associated with stagflation.
 Mechanism: SAS goes left, then government adds more money and AD goes right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Expected inflation
\series default
 doesn't make real GDP fluctuate because SAS and AD both go up at the same
 rate.
 (More precisely, SAS shifts left because producers expect inflation, and
 AD shifts right because the money wage rate rises.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\series bold
rational expectation
\series default
 is the best forecast based on all relevant information and is often wrong,
 thanks economists!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the end, it turns out that faster-than-expected inflation is like demand-pull
 inflation and lower-than-expected inflation is...
 exactly that.
 TODO: understand this
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Deflation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One-time falls in the price level can be caused by lower aggregate demand,
 or higher short-run aggregate supply, but this is not deflation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Deflation is a persistently falling price level, which requires one of the
 above conditions to happen for a long time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The quantity theory of money gives us
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\text{Inflation rate} & =\text{Money growth rate}\\
 & \phantom{=}+\text{Rate of velocity change}\\
 & \phantom{=}-\text{Real GDP growth rate}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and since deflation is just negative inflation, we can use this to figure
 out the money growth rate at which there is zero inflation.
 Below this, there is deflation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since deflation is rare, it is usually unanticipated.
 So it causes some effects, like:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Workers receive more real wage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Employers hire fewer workers, so employment decreases and output falls.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Firms invest less and slows potential GDP growth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Low nominal interest rate increases cash holdings and decreases velocity
 of circulation (which can lead to a vicious cycle)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Deflation is ended by removing its cause.
 You could simply print more money.

Sales taxes also add to the tax wedge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taxes on capital income (interest) lower saving and investment, slowing
 the growth of real GDP.

\begin_layout Standard
Automatic fiscal stimulus react to the economy automatically.
 For example,

 It's probably less than 
\begin_inset Formula $1$

 due to the crowding-out effect.
 The

However, any two of those determines the last.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practice, the Bank of Canada controls the short-term interest rate via
 the 
\series bold
overnight loans rate
\series default
.
 It typically changes this rate in increments of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.25\%$
\end_inset

 This rate determines the

bank rate
\series default

\begin_layout Standard
When the overnight rate changes, the

short-term bill rate
\series default
 and

 also go up.
 The short-term bill rate (3-month Treasury bills) basically matches the
 overnight rate due to the 
\series bold
powerful substitution effect
\series default
 (basically banks can choose between them because they're basically equivalent).
 The long-term bond rate (for large corporate bonds) trails above both rates
 and fluctuates less.
