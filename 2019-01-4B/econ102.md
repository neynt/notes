## Chapter 1

- **Scarcity** is the source of all economic problems.
- **Economics** studies how to allocate limited resources to satisfy unlimited
  human wants.
- **Microeconomics** focuses on the choices of individuals and businesses.
- **Macroeconomics** focuses on the choices and performance of countries.

- Principles
  - 1. All decisions involve tradeoffs.
    - Society faces the important tradeoff of efficiency vs. equity.
      - To achieve greater equity, can redistribute wealth -- but this reduces
        incentive to produce, reducing efficiency and shrinking the overall
        pie.
  - 2. Cost is what you give up.
    - Opportunity costs are relevant.
    - In economics, nothing is free. Delve deeper and there is a cost,
      opportunity or otherwise.
  - 3. Rational people often think at the margin.
    - That is, marginal changes.
  - 4. People respond to incentives.
  - 5. Trade makes everyone better off.
  - 6. Markets usually organize trade well.
    - The **invisible hands** of economics:
      - Prices are determined by the interaction of buyers and sellers.
      - Such prices usually maximize society's total economic well-being.
    - Without money, you need a **double coincidence of wants** for trade to
      happen.
  - 7. Governments can improve market outcomes.
    - Markets can fail due to:
      - Externalities, like pollution
      - Market power, like monopolies in which case public policy may increase
        efficiency.
    - Or, can use policy to increase equity.
    - Tax and welfare redistribute the pie.
  - 8. A country's wealth depends on its ability to produce.
  - 9. Prices rise when the government prints too much money.
    - This is called **inflation**.
  - 10. Society faces a short-term tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.

## Chapter 2

- Economists have two roles:
  - Scientists: Explain how the world works.
  - Policy advisors: Try to improve it.
- Use **models** that incorporate simplifying **assumptions** to study the
  world.

- **Circular flow diagram**: Shows the flow of dollars through markets.
  - Two types of actors: households and firms
  - Two markets: goods and services; factors of production
  - Factors of production are: land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship
    - Returns are:
      - Labour: wages.
      - Land: rent.
      - Capital: interest.
      - Entrepreneurship: capital.
  - (Firms sell | households buy) goods and services, in return for (revenue |
    spending).
  - (Households provide | Firms use) factors of production, in return for
    (wages/rent/interest/profit).

- **Production possibilities frontier**: Shows the possible production of goods
  of various types given available resources and technology
  - (Slides) Opportunity wine cost of cloth is lower in England. England is
    "better" at cloth than France, and France is "better" at wine than England.
  - Better technology shifts the PPF outward
  - Straight line implies similar production mechanisms; bow-shaped (concave
    down) implies different skills and increasing opportunity costs

- Scientists vs. policy makers.
  - Scientists make positive statements: "This has happened"
  - Policy advisors make normative statements: "We should do this"
  - Only positive statements can be confirmed or refuted.
  - Economists often disagree about the validity of theories, and have
    different personal values. So they often have normative views.

- This is the end of microeconomics review.

- If you want to do online exercises, use my course ID so I get kickbacks
- TODO: Review Ch3 (Supply and Demand)

- Class Review chp 1 and 2.docx
  - 1. Equity increases, efficiency decreases.
  - 2. The objective may be to make teachers spend more time in the classroom
    and teach more. But this can also hurt the supply of teachers.
  - 3. micro, micro, macro, macro, micro
  - 4. Straight line: Constant opportunity cost. Bow shape: Increasing
    opportunity cost due to differences in capability.
  - 5. With straight line PPFs:
    - α can produce 150 popcorn or 250 peanuts
    - β can produce 300 popcorn or 100 peanuts
    - Bunch of questions about this ugghh

- GDP
  - GNP: Gross national product. Includes income of citizens that are working
    elsewhere, and excludes income of noncitizens.

- omg this class is so slow

## Chapter 20

- Ch20 review
- 1. What parts of GDP do the following affect?
  - Y = C + I + G + X - M
  - a. family buys new refrigerator
    - C up, Y up
    - on exam, things are made in Canada by default
  - b. person buys new house
    - I up, Y up
  - c. ford sells a car from inventory
    - I down, C/I up (depending on personal/business), Y same
  - d. you buy a pizza
    - C up, Y up
  - e. quebec repaves highway 50
    - G up, Y up
  - f. person buys a bottle of French wine
    - C up, M up
  - g. Honda expands its Ontario factory
    - I up, Y up
- 2. Farmer sells wheat to baker for $2; baker sells bread for $3. Final
  contribution to GDP is?
  - $3, because bread is the final good.
- 3. Nominal/real GDP (per capita) based on table of goods, prices, and
  productions
  - If unspecified, assume real GDP rather than nominal LMAO.
- 4. Consumption $4000, investment $2000, government purchases $1500, exports
  $500, imports $600, taxes $1200, transfer payments $400, depreciation $300.
  What is GDP?
  - It is 4000 + 2000 + 1500 + (500 - 600)
  - If the question mentions "transfer payments", then "government
    expenditures" does NOT include them. Otherwise it does.
  - Taxes are not included because they're what the government spends.
- 5. Flour mill makes $700 to a bakery and $300 to consumers. Water supplier
  makes $200 to bakery and $100 to consumers. Baker producers $1500 of bread to
  consumers. Wages are $400, $200, and $200. GDP is? Profits are? GDP based on
  income?
  - GDP = 300 + 100 + 1500 = 1900.
  - Profits = 600 + 100 + 400 = 1100.
  - Wages = 1100 + 800 = 1900. woow they're the same

- We can break down unemployment by demographic and geographic information.
- 2009 was a Mancession
- Labour force participation rates slowly declined for men; rapidly increased
  for women from 1950 to 2010. Explanations:
  - Better home appliances
  - Lighter work week (more part time which is so feminine)
  - Smaller families (less childcare)
  - Societal equality
  - Increase in demand for female-dominated jobs

- Exercises. What happens to u-rate? What's happening in the labour market?
  - Sue lost her job and begins looking for a new one.
    - u-rate increases, seems good
  - Jon gives up looking for work after a year.
    - u-rate decreases, seems bad
  - Sam lost his job and finds a worse part-time job.
    - u-rate stays the same, seems bad

## Chapter 21. Jobs and inflation

- The quantity theory of money: MV = PY. M: quantity of money, V: dollar
  velocity, P: price level, Y: total output.
- Indexation is adjusting income using the inflation rate.
- Midterm has GDP deflator, CPI

<!-- 2019-02-25 -->

## Chapter 24. Money, the Price Level, and Inflation

- See prof during class hours to review midterm

- Example:
  - You find a $50 bill. Reserve requirement is 20%. Maximum money supply
    increase? Minimum?
  - Max is $250. Min is $50.

- Example:
  - Y=800 bushels of corn. V=constant. MS=$2000. P=$5/bushel
  - Then velocity of money is 2.
  - If, in 2009, MS goes 5% up to $2100, then the nominal GDP goes to $4200 and
    the inflation rate is 5%.
    - GDP = 2 (velocity of money) * 2100 (money supply) = 4200
  - If, additionally, Y increases to 824 in 2009, then the inflation rate is
    actually 2%. An increase in real GDP offsets an increase in the money
    supply.

## Chapter 25. Forex

What would happen to Canadian net exports if:
- US recession (falling incomes, rising unemployment)?
  --> Decrease, since US buys less from us.
- Canadian consumers buy more Made in Canada.
  --> Increase, since imports fall.
- Mexican goods increase in price faster than Canadian goods.
  --> Increase, since competition is less.

## Chapter 26. Aggregate supply and demand

What would happen to AD?
- 10-year-old investment tax credit expires.
  --> Decreases, since there's more money in people's pockets.
  --> Curve shifts left.
- Canadian exchange rate falls.
  --> Increases, since exports increase.
  --> Curve shifts right.
- Fall in prices increases the real value of consumer's wealth.
  --> We move along the curve to the right.
- Sales taxes are replaced with taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains.
  --> Curve does not shift, but demand increases because the increase in
  consumption is way more than the decrease in investment. ???

## Chapter 27. Expenditure multipliers

- Final will be mostly post-midterm2 material.

- LAS/SAS/AD model examples.
  - Crisis in the middle east:
    - We import oil from there, so SAS left; GDP down, price level up.
    - Now we want better wages, so SAS left; GDP down, price level up.
      Stagflation.
    - Classical view: Now people are scared and people are fine with low wages,
      so we eventually shift back to LAS-AD intersection.
  - USA recession:
    - They buy a lot from us, so AD left; GDP down, price level down.
    - Now what happens? Wages get lower, so SAS right, and we end up with the
      same GDP but a lower price level.

- Aggregate expenditure

- Combining AS-AD and AE models
  - Suppose that the price level rises, decreasing real GDP.
    - Then, AE shifts down to reflect lower autonomous expenditure.
  - Suppose that autonomous expenditure rises.
    - Then, the equilibrium GDP rises and AD shifts to the right.
    - Then, prices start to rise to reach SAS-AD equilibrium.
    - This brings AE down
    - Eventually, workers negotiate wages and we're brought to the same real
      GDP at a higher price level.

- That is all for today. Wokia is sick.

## Chapter 28. Business cycle

- had a super kawaii substitute prof today
- Macroeconomics is a soup; microeconomics is a cake.

<!-- 2019-04-01 -->

## Chapter 29. Fiscal policy

- oh god what we have to do ch29?
- How bad is a deficit? Depends on if it's spent on consumption or investment.
  Consumption sucks and starts vicious cycles. Investment produces future
  wealth.
- we will see lots of AS-AD plots in the final.

## Chapter 30. Monetary policy

- TODO: Review cause-and-effect chain of overnight rate increase.
- In the presence of stagflation, monetary policy suggests that you should
  decrease the money supply
- Final will be 90-100 multiple choice questions.
