# SE 350: Operating Systems

Professor: Sebastian Fischmeister.

## Introduction

An operating system makes it easy to use your hardware by providing a collection of abstractions. Its responsibilities include:

- Managing resources like CPU and RAM
- Providing services to system users
- Consuming resources itself

### Background

Originally, hardware was expensive (compared to people). Now it is cheap, so we want to make it easier to use. A computer has lots of hairy parts, including:

- CPUs
- Memory
- I/O modules (like disk, network)
- Timers
- Interrupt controllers
- System buses

**User-visible registers** are accessible by programs in user space. These include **data registers** and **address registers**. 

**Invisible registers** are not easily accessible. For example, **Control** and **status** registers are invisible, and **conditional codes**/**flags** are used only implicitly.

**Interrupts** are events that cause the CPU to jump directly to an interrupt handler before restoring the current context. Types of interrupts:

- program: for bad behavior in the program
- timer: generated to run things at a scheduled interval
- I/O: signals completion or error of an I/O controller, e.g. in direct memory access
- hardware failure
