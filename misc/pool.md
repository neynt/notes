# notes from APA Lee Brett Billiard Instruction

## lesson 1

- don't hug the table. stand farther back, this lets you see better
- don't shuffle back. that's a sign you're too close.

## lesson 2

- right-handed, so put the middle of the right foot on the aiming line
- left foot opens up hips in a snooker stance: open to the side
- training drill: put all the pool balls on the table, step in, step back out

## lesson 3

- ideal bring length: 6-10 inches
- "playing inside": when you're too short at the back. fix by holding cue
  further back.
- ten different shots:
  - open bridge on table
  - closed bridge on table
  - open bridge on rail
  - closed bridge on rail
  - frozen to rail
    - bridge on rail, come back as far as possible, put weight on fingers
  - shoot over pocket
  - shooting over ball
- snooker players have four contact points:
  - cue hand
