# Hackers and Painters

By Paul Graham.

This guy has many of the same thoughts that 13-year-old me had, if not present
me. So I realize that reading this is mainly echo-chambering myself. But it's
nice to have reassurance that someone else thought like me, and became
extremely successful (possibly, but probably not, because of it).

## Chapter 1: Why Nerds are Unpopular

- There is a popularity hierarchy in grade school.
- There are five tiers, with chads and stacies in Tier I and nerds in Tier IV,
  and each tier sitting with each other at the lunch tables. Graham was a nerd.
- Your popularity tends to inversely correlate with your intelligence.
- Popularity is a self-sustaining made-up concept that arises because schools
  are primarily a means to keep kids in one place while their parents do
  productive things in society, and only secondarily a means to teach kids
  useful information, and so social hierarchies arise much like they do in
  prison.
- Everyone is pretending. Nobody actually reads Les Miserables, so Graham just
  read the Cliff's notes. Turns out, teacher was also pulling test questions
  from the Cliff's notes.
- School is worst around the ages of 12-14. Gets better as high school starts
  to segregate people.
- A few teachers really do care and are really good, but they are "swimming
  upstream".
- "Character building" in school usually means "doing what someone else thinks
  is right, rather than what you think is right", and so Graham developed an
  aversion to anything having to do with character building.
- Similar for "empathy", but empathy is actually useful because you don't
  necessarily have to give in to the other side -- just to understand them.
  This can come in useful in wars, where you want to understand the other side
  so you can give them exactly what they DON'T want.

## Chapter 2: Hackers and Painters

- After finishing school in CS, I did a Master's in painting.
- Good coding is a lot more like painting than like science or engineering.
- With coding, originality comes first, then skill. With science, skill comes
  first, then originality.
- Good code is judged by its longetivity and popularity, just like art.
- CODE IS ART CODE IS ART CODE IS ART
- Static type checking is bad because it is rigid and constrains thought.
  - (with modern functional languages I believe this is now untrue)

## Chapter 3: What you Can't Say

- TW: Right-wing ideas
- Innovation comes from iconoclasm.
- "Moral fashions" are basically winners of a popularity contest. They come and
  go, and vary between cultures.
- Nobody cares if you say things that are obviously wrong. People care if you
  say things that go against the moral fashion and might be true. Example:
  Galileo's revolving Earth, Darwin's evolution
- "That's untrue" is a good rebuttal. "That's obscene" should make you think
  "oh shit, am I on to something?"
- "Hate speech" sounds like a phrase out of 1984.

## Chapter 4: Good Bad Attitude

- "Hack" is ugly solution, as well as brilliant solution
- Hackers don't like copyright

## Chapter 5: The Other Road Ahead

- Make things people want

## Chapter 6: How to Make Wealth

- Make things people want
- Wealth is the product of a person's capacity to produce

## Chapter 7: Mind the Gap

- Anything that is possible is fair
- I deserve my money

## Chapter 8: A Plan for Spam

- Naive Bayesian classifier based on word presence works Surprisingly Well
- False positives far more expensive than false negatives

## Chapter 9: Taste for Makers

- Having good taste is important, because if you can't recognize brilliance,
  you can't reliably produce it

## Chapter 10: Programming Languages Explained

- Machine code is a thing
- Oh, high level languages are a better thing!
- Static typing vs. dynamic typing
- Object oriented is also a thing!

## Chapter 11: The Hundred-Year Language

- Good languages have simple foundations
- Its programs should be real short

## Chapter 12: Beating the Averages

- Lisp made Viaweb beat everyone else
- The Blub paradox: Your opinion on languages is only reliable if you actually
  understand the most expressive abstract ones there are. Otherwise you look up
  and just see weirdness.

## Chapter 13: Revenge of the Nerds

- Pointed-hair bosses don't know anything and tell you to use C++ mainly for
  business reasons and don't realize that different languages have different
  power
- Lisp is great
- You can't be average as a startup or you die.

## Chapter 14: The Dream Language

- Terse
- All code you write should be the interesting bit that makes your program
  different
- It should have an extensive, really well designed standard library
- You should be able to modify the language to your liking (macrooos?
  racket?????)
- It should have a REPL
- You should be able to really easily write throwaway scripts, because those
  tend to become long-lasting programs

## Chapter 15: Design and Research

- When people ask "What do you do?" and you don't want to talk about it, say "I'm designing a new dialect of Lisp".
- Design has to be good, and really good design is new
- Research has to be new, and reall good research is good
