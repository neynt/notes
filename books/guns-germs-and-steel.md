# Guns, Germs, and Steel

By Jared Diamond. 1998 Pulitzer in general nonfiction.

## Prologue: Yali's question

- Why do white people have so much cargo (modern technology)?
- It's not genetics!
- In fact, native people may actually be smarter because evolution. Nature:
  Hunter/gatherer society means you need smarts to survive; comfy city doesn't
  really care. Hunter/gatherer society is constantly stimulating; comfy city
  means rotting your brain watching TV
  - (though, I'd argue that it takes similar amounts of brain to thrive and
    reproduce in a modern city than in the wild; both are ruthless in their own
    way)
- Some people ACTUALLY THINK that by explaining the reasons behind something,
  you are justifying or defending it. (Apparently this is a common way people's
  brains work.) Author explains: I am not justifying anything. I am just
  explaining it. Got it?
- We know lots of proximate causes for societal phenomena, like "white people
  are on top because they invented steam engines first". But what about the
  ultimate causes? Let's go back to 14000BC and find out!
  - (tbf an ultimate cause is just a proximate cause of a proximate cause of a
    proximate cause until we feel like "yup, that's the REAL reason something
    happened")

## Chapter 1: Up to the starting line (before 11000BC)

## Chapter 9

- Lots of factors have to come together for animals to be domesticated, just as
  lots of factors have to come together for a marriage to be happy. (Anna
  Karenina principle -- "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is
  unhappy in its own way.")
- Conquered societies did not fail to domesticate their local animals; their
  local animals are incapable of being domesticated.
