## plover

Plover lets you type ridiculously fast by using chords of keys to represent
sounds. This technique is called steno. A steno keyboard looks like this:

```
_____________________
| |T|P|H| |F|P|L|T|D|
|S|-----|*|----------
| |K|W|R| |R|B|G|S|Z|
-----|A|O|E|U|-------
```

- Within a chord, sounds are read left to right.
- Consonants represent themselves.
- [F] can also make the 'v' or 's' sounds.
- [G] can also make the 'ing' sound.
- Single short vowels are spelled literally.
- Short vowel clusters are spelled out phonetically.

- Steno order: `STKPWHRAO*EUFRPBLGTSDZ`
- You can drop unstressed vowels.
  - e.g. tablet -> TABLT
- You can violate steno order once, as long as it saves a stroke and the
  swapped sounds are adjacent in both steno order and the word.
  - e.g. portal -> PORLT

- EU makes 'i'
- To make long vowels, add the two keys from the opposite side
  - Exception: OE for 'oh'
- Diphthongs: AU for 'aw', OU for 'ow', OEU for 'oi'
- Vowel disambiguators:
  - AE for the word spelled with "e" and "a".
  - AO for words spelled with "oo" or "oa".
