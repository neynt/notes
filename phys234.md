# PHYS 234: Quantum Physics 1

Professor: Qing-Bin Lu

## History

A while back, physics had some problems which they solved.

- The **Michelson-Morley experiment** failed to measure any movement relative to the "luminiferous aether".
- The distribution of **blackbody radiation**, or cavity radiation, could not be explained.
  - Wien's approximation worked for short wavelengths, not long
  - Rayleigh-Jeans worked for long wavelengths, not short

Problems were solved like so:

- Blackbody radiation: Planck's energy quanta
- Photoelectric effect: Einstein's light quanta
- Heat capacity of solids: Einstein's model of solids
- Bright line optical spectra: Bohr's model of the atom

### Blackbody radiation

Wien's approximation worked for only short wavelengths. Rayleigh-Jeans worked for only long wavelengths.

But Planck's empirical formula worked for **all** wavelengths! He fixed the ultraviolet catastrophe.

u(v)dv = c₁ / (e^(c₂v/T) - 1) * v³ dv

Planck later explained this formula using **energy quanta** -- it can be derived if you assume that electromagnetic radiation with frequency \nu can only be absorbed or emitted in energies of nh\nu.

### Photoelectric effect

Einstein proposed **light quanta** to explain the photoelectric effect. He later used energy quanta to explain the heat capacity of solids.
