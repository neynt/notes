# PHYS 234: Quantum Physics 1

Professor: Qing-Bin Lu

## History

A while back, physics had some problems.

- **The Michelson-Morley experiment** failed to measure any movement relative to the "luminiferous aether".
- The distribution of **blackbody radiation**, or cavity radiation, could not be explained.
  - Wien's approximation worked for short wavelengths, not long
  - Rayleigh-Jeans worked for long wavelengths, not short

Problems were solved like so:

- Blackbody radiation: Planck's energy quanta
- Photoelectric effect: Einstein's light quanta
- Heat capacity of solids: Einstein's model of solids
- Bright line optical spectra: Bohr's model of the atom
