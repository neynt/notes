## hammy

### dailies
1. Get green waste bag from under the kitchen sink.
2. Lock cats out of room.
3. Turn on the big bright light for better visibility. (Left back corner of
   room behind bed, turn black knob of top light)
4. Put on gloves (optional)
5. Open cage. Use hanging clothes organizer to hold the lid open. Look around
   and discard bedding that has been soiled by pee. It's yellow and sometimes
   still damp. His favorite spot is inside the shelter, closest to the front of
   the cage. You will need to remove the lid of the shelter to access it. This
   should be the only place ~90% of the time.
6. Refill food if the bowl is empty. Use ~0.5cm layer of Sunburst seed blend at
   the bottom of the food bowl, and 3 critter cubes. Should happen every 2-3
   days.
7. Refill water if the bottle is running low. Should happen every ~week.
8. Press in the ball bearing at the tip of the water bottle and swirl it around
   to make sure it isn't stuck. It happens!
9. As needed: If the wheel is soiled with pee, wipe it with a wet paper towel,
   then dry it well with a dry paper towel (moisture is bad for hamsters).
10. Tie green bag and discard in building's waste chute.

### optional enrichment
- Replenish special toys / treats
- Feed individual pieces of food with your finger
- Sprinkle little bits of Sunburst herb mix in cage or in food bowl. This
  should be less than 5% of his diet.
