## smokey's food

- Feeding times: 07:00 and 19:00.
- Feed 1 can of Friskies in a white bowl.
- Watch him eat. He eats more if he is watched than if you leave.
- Discard any uneaten food in the trash.
- Clean bowl in kitchen sink.

### advanced smokey feeding schedule

When I'm actually around, I usually follow this schedule.

- Weekday feeding times: 07:00, 19:00, 21:00, 23:00.
- Weekend feeding times: 07:00, 12:00, 17:00, 22:00.
  - Uh maybe it's bad to make these inconsistent? If we just fed him twice a
    day he'd probably adapt fine and just eat more each time right?
- Feed a fresh can. He will usually leave about half the food, which you can
  save as leftovers by covering the bowl with a small plate and putting it in
  the fridge.
- If there is leftover food, heat the leftovers by rehydrating with a small
  splash of water, then heating in the microwave until the food is mildly warm
  to the touch after mixing, usually 15-25s.
   - Don't add too much water or overmix. He likes it softened but not pasty.
- Only feed leftovers once; discard the remaining afterward.

## quincy & qualia's food

- Feeding times: 07:00, 18:00, 23:00
- Feed 1 can of Royal Canin each, in a small white plate.
- First place down Quincy's food in the common area and have him start eating.
  This distracts him so that you can put down Qualia's food uninterrupted.
- Then, place down Qualia's food in the master bedroom and close the door.
- Open the door after 15 minutes and let Quincy eat whatever Qualia left over.

## litter boxes

There are four litter boxes: common washroom, laundry area, living room, and
master bathroom. Each should be scooped daily, and fully changed monthly or
whenever you notice it's nasty.

1. Get green waste bag from under the kitchen sink.
2. For each litter box:
   - Remove lid from litter box.
   - Use metal scoop to remove waste and clumps from each litter box.
   - Top up litter if it's running low. Litter should be ~3in deep.
3. Tie green bag and discard in building's waste chute.

## water

The cat fountain should be refilled every week and whenever it's running low.

When you refill the cat fountain, do a full clean. Unplug it, dump out existing
water, wipe inside surfaces, clean the filter sponge, and put it all back
together. Then plug it back in and pour in fresh water.

## brushing

- There is a brush you can use to remove excess hair from the cats.
- Smokey likes having his cheeks brushed. He doesn't have too much patience for
  having the rest of his body brushed. Brush his cheeks a lot to build up good
  will, then you can go for the rest of his length.

## nail clipping

- There is a nail clipper you can use to trim the cats' nails.
- It is easiest to trim them when they are sleeping. Otherwise they get
  irritated fast.
- Give them a treat while you trim them to reinforce positive vibes.
- Smokey had no front claws when we adopted him :(

## play

- To get some fitness in, you can have the cats chase around the laser pointer.
- Quincy & Qualia will chase it around the floor.
- Smokey prefers to chase it around on my bed. He doesn't really like to jump
  around the hardwood floor.
- Careful not to point into eyes.

## priorities

Taking care of cats is a lot of work! If you can't do everything, prioritize in
this order.

- Food and litter box are, of course, musts.
- Brushing daily is important to prevent hairballs.
- Nail clipping weekly is important as well to prevent curled back nails, but
  can be difficult.
