## litter boxes

There are four litter boxes: common washroom, laundry area, living room, and
master bathroom. Each should be scooped daily, and fully changed monthly or
whenever you notice it's nasty.

1. Get green waste bag from under the kitchen sink.
2. For each litter box:
   - Remove lid from litter box.
   - Use metal scoop to remove waste and clumps from each litter box.
   - Top up litter if it's running low. Litter should be ~3in deep.
3. Tie green bag and discard in building's waste chute.

## smokey

### feeding

- Feeding times: 07:00 and 19:00.
- Feed 1 can of Friskies in a white bowl.
- Watch him eat. He eats more if he is watched than if you leave.
- Discard any uneaten food in the trash.
- Clean bowl in kitchen sink.

### play

- To get some fitness in, you can have smokey chase around the laser pointer.
- He prefers to chase it around on my bed. He doesn't really like to chase
  around the laser pointer on the hardwood floor.
- Careful not to point into his eyes.

### brushing

- There is a brush you can use to groom Smokey.
- He likes having his cheeks brushed.
- He doesn't have too much patience for having the rest of his body brushed.
  Brush his cheeks a lot to build up good will, then you can go for the rest of
  his length.

### nail clipping

- When we adopted Smokey he had no front claws :(
- There is a nail clipper you can use to maintain Smokey's back claws.

#### more frequent feeding schedule

When I'm actually around, I usually follow this schedule.

- Weekday feeding times: 07:00, 19:00, 21:00, 23:00.
- Weekend feeding times: 07:00, 12:00, 17:00, 22:00.
  - Uh maybe it's bad to make these inconsistent?
- Feed a fresh can. He will usually leave about half the food, which you can
  save as leftovers by covering the bowl with a small plate and putting it in
  the fridge.
- If there is leftover food, heat the leftovers by rehydrating with a small
  splash of water, then heating in the microwave until the food is mildly warm
  to the touch after mixing, usually 15-25s.
   - Don't add too much water or overmix. He likes it softened but not pasty.
- Only feed leftovers once; discard the remaining afterward.

## quincy & qualia

### feeding

- Feeding times: 07:00, 18:00, 23:00
- Feed 1 can of Royal Canin each, in a small white plate.
- First place down Quincy's food in the common area and have him start eating.
  Then, place down Qualia's food in the master bedroom.
  - Quincy eats whatever plate is put down first.
  - Qualia will follow you to the master bedroom to eat from the other plate.

### brushing

- Brush similarly to Smokey.

### nail clipping

- When they are sleeping it's a good time to get a few nails clipped.

## priorities

Taking care of cats is a lot of work! If you can't do everything, prioritize in
this order.

- Food and litter box are, of course, musts.
- Brushing daily is important to prevent hairballs.
- Nail clipping weekly is important as well to prevent curled back nails, but
  can be difficult.
