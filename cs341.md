# CS 341: Algorithms

Professor: Semih Salihoglu

## Introduction

An algorithm is a well-defined procedure to solve a computational problem. Some examples include:

- Sorting
  - Input: Array
  - Output: Sorted array
- Matrix multiplication
  - Input: matrices A, B
  - Output: A * B
- Travelling salesman problem
  - Input: Weighted road network
  - Output: Cheapest spanning path

Coming up with algorithms is fun, but not nearly all there is to do. We also analyze algorithms to understand their costs in terms of time, memory, and I/O.

Types of algorithms:

- **Serial** vs. **parallel**: whether parallel computation is allowed.
- **Deterministic** vs. **randomized**: whether the algorithm's execution is determined completely by its input, or if it makes use of an external source of randomness to improve certain characteristics of the algorithm.
- **Exact** vs. **Approximate**: what kind of answer the algorithm gives.

In CS 341, we mainly focus on serial, deterministic, exact algorithms.
