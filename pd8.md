# PD 8: Intercultural skills

## 1. Course introduction

- This course is about how culture affects workplace interactions.
- This is important because you will work with people from different cultures.

## 2. Impact of culture on thinking and behaviour

- Culture is the collective programming of the mind
  - which distinguishes groups of people.
  - Dr. Geert Hofstede
- Visible culture (behaviours)
  - Dress, language, music, food, greetings
- Hidden culture (values and beliefs)
  - Use of time and space
  - Attitudes toward power and hierarchy
  - Roles of individuals and groups
- Affects the workplace too
  - Example: Arriving late for a meeting
    - North America: Unprofessional
    - Latin America: Acceptable
- Common sense isn't really a thing
- Clash of cultural icebergs: We interpret their top with our bottom
- Cultural conditioning: The learning of culture
  - Example: Smiling at strangers
    - US, Canada: Appropriate
    - Russia, France, Japan: No
- Culture vs. personality
  - Individuals differ within a group
- Michigan fish test:
  - Picture of fish, plants, and rocks
  - Americans began with the large fish
  - Japanese started by saying "it's a river" or "it's a pond"
  - Japanese provided 70% more background information
  - Analytical vs. holistic information processing, culturally
  - Asians love context
- Reactions to cultural differences:
  - Denying/minimizing: We are all the same
  - Projected similarity: Assuming others are more similar to us than they
    really are
  - Stereotypes:
    - Assuming stuff about individual based on group
    - Cultural generalizations: helpful stereotypes. s/all/many
  - Discrimination:
    - With identical resumes, English names 35% more likely than Chinese, Indian,
      or Greek names to be interviewed
    - Name pronunciation effect: Difficult to pronounce names (Greek, Polish,
      Thai) also a disadvantage
    - Accent-based discrimination: Accent correlated with lack of credibility
  - Ethnocentrism:
    - Our culture is superior
    - "It's rude to be late" is ethnocentric
- Gender, race, ethnicity, age also affect behaviour
