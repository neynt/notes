## Floating point arithmetic

Computers approximate real numbers using floating point numbers. This approximation can lead to surprisingly large errors:

- In 5-digit arithmetic, e^-5.5 = 0.0026363 if you use 1 - x + x^2/2 - x^3/3!... but 0.0040868 if you use (1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/3!)^-1
- In 4-digit arithmetic, one of the solutions to x^2 + 62.1x + 1 can be either -0.0200 or -0.0161.
