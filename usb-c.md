## usb-c: save me!!

Notes from https://dongknows.com/usb-c-vs-thunderbolt-3-explained/

USB-C is a **port type**. It's the physical specification for the cable's
connector and wiring.

Thunderbolt 3 is "high quality" USB-C. TB3 cables are just really good USB-C
cables. Not all USB-C cables are TB3, but all TB3 cables are USB-C.

A **connection standard** specifies how the cable is used. Here are some
connection standards:

- USB 1.1: 12 Mbps. Ancient, obsolete.
- USB 2.0: 480 Mbps. Old school.
- USB 3.2
  - Gen 2x2 aka USB 3.2: 20Gbps. Not really used much
  - Gen 2 aka USB 3.1 Gen 2 aka USB 3.1: 10Gbps. Mainstream.
  - Gen 1 aka USB 3.1 Gen 1 aka USB 3.0: 5Gbps. Very mainstream.
- USB4: "Encompasses" Thunderbolt 3
  - USB4 40Gbps
  - USB4 20Gbps

USB cables are generally passive. They just serve as wires connecting the two
ends. Due to overhead, only at most 2/3 of the stated bandwidth is available to
the application.

- Thunderbolt (original): Mini DP port type, 10Gbps
- Thunderbolt 2: Mini DP, 20Gbps
- Thunderbolt 3: USB-C, 40Gbps
  - Can also work as USB 3.2 Gen 2x2.
  - Can sometimes work as USB4.
- Thunderbolt 4: TB3 but with some improved quality specs things no one cares about.

Thunderbolt is generally better than USB. Thunderbolt cables generally have
active circuitry. About 90% of the stated speed should be available to the
application.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
