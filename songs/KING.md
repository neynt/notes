幽閉　利口　逝く前に                  Locking up the clever one before they die[1]
ユーヘイじゃ利口に難儀ダーリン        You hey, it was a pain to get you to obey
幽閉　ストップ　知ってないし          Don't lock me up! It's not like I knew
勘弁にしといて　なんて惨忍            Forgive me. You're so cruel

人様願う　欠片のアイロニ              The irony of the fragments people wish for
だれもが願う無機質なような            Everyone wants this inorganic thing
一足先に始めてたいような              Wanting to start one step ahead
先が見えないヴァージンハッピーショー  An unpredictable virgin happy show

無いの新たにお願い一つ                I don't have a single new wish
愛も変わらずおまけに                  My love's the same as always [2], and there's no
ワーニング　ワーニング                Warning warning
無いのあなたにお願い一つ              For you, a single wish:
張り詰めた思い込め                    My strained conviction

[Chorus]:
レフトサイド　ライトサイド            Left side, right side
歯をむき出して　パッパッパッ          Bare your fangs, pa pa pa
照れくさいね                          How embarrassing
レフトサイド　ライトサイド            Left side, right side
歯を突き出して　パッパッパッ          Stick out your fangs, pa pa pa

HAHA
YOU ARE KING
YOU ARE KING

無邪気に遊ぶ                          Playing innocent
期待期待のダーリンダーリン            You're the darling, darling that I expected
健気に笑う　痛い痛いの消える          When you laugh admirably, my pain, pain disappears
無様に〇しねる　苦い思いもなくなって  I'm able to die clumsily, and my bitter thoughts disappear too
ラララブウ　ラッタッタ                Lo-lo-love, ra-ta-ta
嫌い嫌いの最低　泣いて　ダウン        I hate it, I hate it, it's the worst -- I'm crying -- and down.

毎度新たにお願い一つ                  I always have a brand-new wish
愛も変わらずピックアップの            My love's the same as always, there's no picked-out
ワーニング　ワーニング                Warning warning
無いのあなたにお願い一つ              For you, a single wish:
張り詰めた思い込め                    My strained conviction

[Chorus]

[1] 逝く means to die, but like, "to go away".
[2] Also a pun with "相変わらず": "the same as always", "unchanged"

## notes

English mostly stolen from aquariantwin/Magenetra. Changed where I disagreed,
but I know nothing and am probably wrong.

The English-language web doesn't really have an interpretation of the song. The
Japanese-language web more clearly states that this song can be interpreted as a
reference to the French revolution. The KING is Louis XVI, and he's about to be
executed. The singer is, like, the queen or something.
