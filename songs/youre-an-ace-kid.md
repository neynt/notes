[Verse 1]
(Yuh)
What's hangin', young hero? Besides your head and spirit
That soul is sayin' somethin' profound, so let 'em hear it
Gave up the "safe and sound" for "bet it all on breakin' ground"
This vacant town was a mistake, and you can't turn around!
Your heroes and your idols turned out insincere and human
Reality's a dog, the fear's too high to keep on movin'
But you ain't interested in losin' are ya?
I thought not
Still too invested and improving- it's that fire you got
You came out to the city. It wasn't what you dreamed
Gave it 150. Was harder than it seemed
You said "goodbye" to home and people who supported you
To chase something invisible, you lived for that distorted view (Damn)
Your sorry superficial buddies like to shun and doubt you
Tonight's the party, everybody's having fun without you! (Man)
Forget 'em, players like us put in the effort
They're just scared of folks with focus cuz they can't predict our weather!

[Chorus]
You're an ace dealt back on the rebound, know that if
You wanna be a diamond star, ya better step up
Next rough patch, cue the rewound-mode
だけど諦めない my soul (My soul)                                             But I won't give up my soul
The road to freedom can't be seen by downcast eyes
So raise your gaze up 'till you're ten feet tall
And shake your fist at the sky!
Refuse to die, or let them make you small
Cuz they'd love just to see you convinced
You're just a brick in the wall
[Verse 2]
社会の期待に及ばなかった、ごめん                                             Sorry I didn't live up to society's expectations
I chose the free life, over money, job stability, men
変化している世界生まれ間の子                                                 A half-breed child, born into a changing world
君は誰の囚人？脱走しないの？                                                 Whose prisoner are you? Are you gonna break free?
Cuz I know, "I said so" don't make it right
「そのやり方だめ」ってまじ聞きたくない。                                     "That's not the right way" is something you really don't want to hear
Talk all night about your troubles, all it's gonna do is pause you
喋るだけなら sorry man, 相変わらず                                           If all you do is talk, sorry man, nothing's going to change
言葉よりが仕草                                                               Actions speak louder than words
Not the most difficult jigsaw
理解不足あり 「若者ことだ」                                                  It's fine you don't understand, "it's a young person problem".
Remind myself to zone on what's ahead of me
まだ閉じ込められてる袋のネズミ                                               I'm still a locked-up rat caught in a trap.
伏し目がちにその道見えないぞ                                                 If you're looking down, you can't see the path
You see the "deeper meaning" only once you've seen the lies, so
この情熱なくなる前に                                                         Before this passion fades away
毎日 defy speech, singin' beside お前 is where I want to be

[Chorus]
You're an ace dealt back on the rebound, know that if
You wanna be a diamond star, ya better step up
Next rough patch, cue the rewound-mode
だけど諦めない my soul (My soul)
The road to freedom can't be seen by downcast eyes
So raise your gaze up 'till your ten feet tall
And shake your fist at the sky!
Refuse to die, or let them make you small
Cuz they'd love just to see you convinced
You're just a brick in the wall
[Bridge]
You're an ace dealt back on the rebound, know that
ダイヤスターになりたいなら努力必要                                           If you wanna be a diamond star, you gotta work hard
最悪の日来たら悪くそう                                                       When the worst days come, it'll look bad
だけど諦めない my soul (My soul)                                             But I won't give up my soul
The road to freedom can't be seen by downcast eyes
So raise your gaze up 'till your 10 feet tall
And shake your fist at the sky
Refuse to die or let them make you small
お前も死なない                                                               You're not dying either
This one will live for tomorrow!!

[Chorus]
You're an ace dealt back on the rebound, know that if
You wanna be a diamond star, ya better step up
Next rough patch, cue the rewound-mode
だけど諦めない my soul (My soul)
The road to freedom can't be seen by downcast eyes
So raise your gaze up 'till your ten feet tall
And shake your fist at the sky!
Refuse to die, or let them make you small
Cuz they'd love just to see you convinced
You're just a brick in the wall

But you're not just a "brick in the wall"
But you're not just a "brick in the wall"
