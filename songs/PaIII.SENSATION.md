# PaIII.SENSATION by Yunosuke

```
寂しくて眠れぬ日々も                On these lonely days when I cannot sleep, I also
今夜辺り、さよなら出来る気がする    Feel like I can say good bye tonight
胸の高鳴り                          My throbbing heartbeats

見透かされた行方知れずの            (that has been seen through) (whereabouts) (unknowingly)
気持ち隠しても既に遅いわ            (feelings) (← even though I hide) (already) (late)
世の常                              (as usual)
```
