# いじめっ子 — original by Mori Calliope

```
Haze you

She's dressed up in diamond dust
A lover of decay
Coated lashes, soul of ashes
What more can I say?

踏みつけたアリの行列なんて 
(stepped-on) (ant) no (procession) (things such as...)

気づいてないと誰もが思う
(not being noticed) to (anyone) ga (think)

(?: Everyone thinks nobody notices a trampled line of ants)

Loving you, killing you, isn't it thrilling?
You've said enough from those guts you've been spilling through
Crying and begging, a lovely sound
I tear at your soul, but you still stick around
What I've found is a treasure indeed
A friend who can bend to my every need
I'll use and abuse you and never feel bad, until suddenly, funnily,
you take my hand
Tangle you tight in the yarns that I've spun
And I'll do it again, to get what I want
Pretend that I'm harmless, I'm actually alarmed this is something
charming to anyone... (wow)
The fact can actually make Death wanna Die?
I'm the one that you love, and I'm making you cry
And it's "just me", after all
(Same shit, different night)

I'll give you fire

心に飼う
(keep (as in, keep a pet) it in your heart)

Hello? 餓狼 餓狼
Hello? (hungry wolf) (hungry wolf)

唸りかける
(howls)

(?: The hungry wolf howls.)

また意地悪な爪を立てて
(again) (unkind) na (claw) wo (extend)

狩ってあげる
(hunt) (give you)

(?: I'll extend my unkind claws and hunt ((for) you?) again.)

Haze you!

When the curtains finally close, and the show's really over
If you glance into my past, it's just nothing new
Lying, conniving, thriving on hate
I'll tell you it was "all for you"

お聞きなさい、ホントの薔薇は
(please listen) (true) no (rose) wa

自分の刺に傷ついたりしないものよ
(oneself) no (thorn) ni (hurt etc.) shinai mono yo

(?: Listen up: A true rose isn't hurt by its own thorns.)

You know, I want you to care that I want you to stay
So I swear I won't blame you if you turn away
At the end of the day, I will smile and give in to this burning and vile
Original sin
'Cause hell is the realization you're selfish
And drawn to the loving, the soft and the helpless
I can see through that façade that you wear
When you're honest, and promise you'll fight the despair
And I'll say it again, that I know I'm the worst
So then how can you spend so much love on the person that hurts you
Like I do?
'Cause inside, I can't hide that I cannot desert you
And if I'm "the world" to you, surely you never stood even a chance at all, didn't you?
It's me, after all
(Same shit, different night
Guess we better light it up)

(chorus repeats)

来訪　宵の羽音
(visit) (evening) no (flapping wing sounds)
熟れ残果琢む鴉かな
(ripe) (left-over-) (fruit) (pick at) (crow) kana

(?: A visit: the sound of flapping wings in the evening. Probably crows picking
at ripe left-over fruit.)

Don't be afraid

いい子ね、もうお眠り
(good kid, already asleep)

I'll give you fire
Just keep it to yourself
Hello, the hungry wolf has come to give you hell
Once again I'll treat you nice
Think twice before you fall
And smile while you do
Love, the me that's killing you
```
