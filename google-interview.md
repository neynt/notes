- Data structures and algorithms: Hash tables, stacks, arrays, space and time
  complexity
- Whiteboard coding
- System design
- Object oriented programming
- Language: Typically C++ or Java, Python and C also used.
- Know Dijkstra's and A* -- may help
- Unit testing, coming up with test cases, integration, security tests
- Know NP complete problems, recognize them
- Tree construction, manipulation
- Discrete math: Counting, probability
- Recursion
- Operating systems: OSes, threads, concurrency, semaphores, mutexes, locks,
  resources, context switching, scheduling
- System design: Feature sets, interfaces, class hierarchies, distributed
  systems, design under constraints
- Internet: Routers, DNS, load balancers, firewalls, search

- Keep talking during the interview.
- Ask clarifying questions. Time or space complexity requirements?
- Keep thinking.

- Practice writing code physically.

## Example coding/engineering interview

- Set of numbers; Find pair of numbers with a desired sum.
- Ask for clarification. How are the numbers stored? Are they integers?
- Constantly think out loud.
- Think through before writing code.
- Simplest solution: Nested loop. O(nÂ²).
- Better solution: Binary search. O(n log n).
- Best solution: Two-ended scan. O(n).
- Note solution of degenerate cases
- Test your code in real time. Think about edge cases.
