# MUSIC 246: Soundtracks

Professor: Simon Wood

<!-- 2019-01-10 -->

## Week 1: What to Listen for in Film

- Required textbook: Reel Music 2nd - Hickman
  - On reserve at Conrad Grebel
- I write music for a living, also a bass player
- Grading is 25% test 1, 30% test 2, 45% final
- All tests are multiple choice
- Homework: Watch a movie every week
- (While talking about academic integrity) You're Waterloo students for god's
  sake. If anyone can cheat, it's you guys.
- Hans Zimmer ruined everything for everybody

- Visceral enjoyment of film depends on suspension of disbelief.
- You like music because patterns. Patterns provide meaning.

- Film: [Apollo 13] ([1995])
- Composer: [James Horner]
  - (Also did Titanic and Avatar)
- Has the Ready Room scene

- Simon was 10 when Apollo 13 happened

- [The Ready Room] scene:
  - Watched twice. First time without sound.
  - Marilyn Lovell lost wedding ring in shower drain; cut immediately to
    astronauts getting ready
  - Directors like showers (not just because of the nudititity)
  - Pay attention also to where music isn't. Figure and ground
  - No music in shower scene:
    - Reflects intimacy of shower.
    - Allows other sounds to cut through -- shower noise and whimpers add
      discomfort
    - Leaves space for ready room scene and launch scene.
  - SHOWERS are SKETCHY PLACES, AREN'T THEY?
  - Music starts shortly before cut from shower to ready room. Made cut less
    jarring.
    - They "anticipated" the cut. Alternatively, sometimes you "hit" the cut,
      or "delay" the cut.
  - Instruments: Brass.
    - Embodies military, heroism, sacrifice.
  - Style: [Chorale].
    - Embodies faith, sacrifice.
    - [Chorale]: A Protestant hymn. Simple melody written for Protestant
      congregation to sing.
    - Astronauts stretch in the shape of a crucifix.
  - Tempo: Slow.
    - Restrained, controlled, professional.
  - Texture changes with the next cut.

- Mrs. Doubtfire recut as a horror movie

- Movies tell stories, and that depends on suspension of disbelief
- Flimmakers minimize anything that goes against suspension of disbelief...
  except music!

- The four general functions of music:
  - 1. [To convey time and place.]
    - Based on (western) history, culture, geography
    - 1930s and 40s films were kinda racist; captured perception, not reality,
      of other cultures
  - 2. [To refine psychology.]
    - Character's inner thoughts. Foreshadowing.
  - 3. [To provide a sense of continuity.]
    - Smooths over cuts.
    - Montages oft employ pop songs.
  - 4. [To provide buildup.]
    - "provides the underpinning for the theatrical buildup of a scene, then
      round it off with a sense of finality"
    - pacing

- Film: [Raiders of the Lost Ark] ([1981])
- Composer: [John Williams]
- This film is a homage to 1940s adventure serials
  - Homage is a French word meaning "homage"
- Three parts: classic theme, love theme, egypt
- Functions [1, 3, 4.
  - F1: Scale change and oboe: Arrival in Egypt.
    - Oboe is closest Western instrument to Egypt/India (but still far)
  - F3: Although location changes quickly from Tibet to Egypt, music stays
    continuous
  - F4: Action makes way for quiet dialogue. Brings action to a close.]

- Film: [Alien Resurrection] ([1997])
- Composer: [John Frizzell]
- "Alien" is one of the best horror films. "Aliens" is one of the best war
  films. This is a big oops
- Functions [2, 4.
  - F2: Music "catches" Call's reaction to hearing Ripley's name. Foreshadows
    the connection between them.
  - F4: Slow dialogue changes to chaotic action, then slows to conclude.]
- Actors weren't expecting Ripley to hit the shot. Watch the uncut footage, is
  funny.

- Closing notes:
  - Read LEARN
  - Get films. Don't get remakes. Get originals.
  - Start paying attention to music.

## Week 2

- Shirt: Reunite Pangea
- Let's learn some terms!

- [Diegesis]: [The world of the narrative].

- [Diegetic music]: [Music that actually happens in the story].
  - aka: Source music, direct music, foreground music
  - Functions 1, creates sense of "realism and immediacy", offers ironic
    comment

- Nondiegetic is not diegetic.
  - aka: Score, underscore, background music
  - Can be composed for the film, or
  - Can be preexisting music adapted to the film

- Film: [The Sting] ([1973])
  - Original composer: [Scott Joplin]
  - Pre-existing music style: Ragtime
  - Listened to: The Entertainer
  - Adapted (very subtly) by: [Marvin Hamlisch]
  - Setting is the Depression, but ragtime comes from 30 years earlier

- Film: [Platoon] ([1986])
  - Composer: [Georges Deleure]
  - Listened to: [Adagio for Strings]
  - Also includes Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings (1938)
    - This was also used in:
      - The Elephant Man (1980)
      - Sicko (2007)
  - "Why'd you send my score back in a week?!"
    - "I didn't need it. I've memorized it."

- Compiled score: Score made entirely out of preexisting music

- Film: [2001: A Space Odyssey] ([1968])
  - Directed by: [Stanley Kubrick]
    - Dude loved compiled scores
    - Molded movie around music he was listening to
  - Compiled score
  - Compiled from: R. Strauss, J. Strauss...
  - Listened to: Ligeti - 2001 - Atmospheres
    - Simon loved this when he was 7

- Style
  - Category of music
  - Instruments used
  - Relation to film

- Film: [Local Hero] ([1983])
  - Composer: [Mark Knopfler]
  - About an American sent to a small Scottish village... to buy the town (oil)
  - Blends folk and pop styles
  - Emphasized guitar
  - Melodies similar to Anglo-Celtic folk music

- Film: [The Godfather] ([1972])
  - Composer: [Nino Rota]
  - Listened to: The Godfather Waltz
    - First statement: Sad trumpet
    - Then, enters: Waltz. It's a dance. Clarinet, some mandolin-family
      instrument. Sicilian wedding band.

- Conceptual approaches
  - Film music falls on a continuum from:
    - [Playing the drama]. Music reinforces emotions in the narrative.
    - [Phrasing the drama]. Music is appropriate for the scene, but can catch
      specific moments of action or emotion.
    - [Hitting the action]. Music accents visual events.
      - Common in cartoons, but should avoid "mickey mousing" (when it's too
        obvious).

- Musical characteristics
  - Melody/theme
    - The "main" line
    - [Leitmotif]
      - Melody associated with narrative thing
      - Instantiated in unique ways
      - [Richard Wagner]
    - Simon's rule: Hummability is positivity

- Simon Wood can't watch GoT; constant sexytime/beheadings. "I get embarrassed"
- Simon was once told "You know, your music is really much better than it
  sounds"

- Film: [Star Wars] ([1977])
  - Composer: [John Williams]
  - Simon saw this film 14 times
  - Don't remind Simon that prequels exist or there will be "difficulties with
    your grade"
  - Listened to: Luke Skywalker theme

- Musical characteristics (cont.)
  - Tempo
    - How fast the music is
    - Can influence perceived speed of film

- Film: [The Return of the King] ([2004])
  - Composer: [Howard Shore]
  - (Watched this)
  - Story is walking to fights, then walking because of bad ring.
  - Hobbit song begins as source music, but then becomes score over a
    discordant suicide charge.
  - Music stops when evil fires arrows.

- Musical characteristics (cont.)
  - Harmony
    - major happy minor sad
    - Consonance is orderly, familiar. Dissonance is weird.
    - Listened to: Main Title - Cider House Rules ([1999])
      - Composer: [Rachael Portman]
      - Highly consonant
      - Women do most of music, but as contractors and musicians... but not
        composers
        - [Sandy DeCrescent]: Prolific female music contractor
    - Listened to: Yes - Meet Joe Black ([1998]) (Composer: [Thomas Newman])
      - Consonant and dissonant
    - Listened to: Bishop's Countdown - Aliens ([1986])
      - Composer: [James Horner]
      - Quite dissonant
      - Becomes tonal for a moment of hope; then disintegrates
      - Segment was most used music in movie trailers for years

- Technical details
  - Three phases of filmmaking
    - 1. Preproduction
      - This is preparation. Script, financing, casting, costume/set design,
        location scouting
    - 2. Production
      - Script and production design is finalized
      - Principle photography
      - Cut -> next scene
      - Cut and that's a wrap -> we're done!
    - 3. Postproduction
      - Editing and assembling the **takes**
      - Visual and audio effects
        - Practical effects often preferable/pure but hard
        - Foley artists are cool
      - Music
        - Original film score is often one of the last things to be made.
        - Composition and recording a score usually takes [5-8] weeks
  - Composer's involvement
    - Hiring
      - Studio contract
      - Freelance
      - Collaborative partnerships, e.g. Spielberg/Williams, Nolan/Zimmer
  - Scripts
    - Give composers a head start
    - Allows research into ethnic, historical influences
      - The Last Samurai (2003) (Composer: [Hans Zimmer])
    - Script alone is generally not enough to compose
      - Script can change a lot
      - No timing or pace information

- [Screenings]
  - These are different opportunities to see the film.
  - [Rushes]: [Film shot in a single day]
  - [Assembly cut]: [Much longer than finished film]
    - e.g. Titanic's assembly cut was 12 hours long
  - [Rough cut]: Closer to finished film
  - [Fine cut/Locked cut]: Most editing completed
  - Most composers begin serious work with the locked cut
    - Not only does this give them timing information, but...
    - Limiting familiarity with film is beneficial

<!-- 2019-01-24 -->

## Week 3

- A [temp track] is [temporary film music for early editing].
  - Often stolen from other films, or classical music.
  - Composers like temp tracks because they provide insight into the director's
    wishes, BUT they can cause the director to become overfamiliar

- The [spotting session] is the first time the director, composer, and music
  editor sit and discuss the placement of [cue]s (timing, approach).
- A [cue] is a single piece for the purpose of the film.
- The [music editor] provides spotting notes/cue sheet.
  - Looks like a table with the columns:
    - cue#: xMy
      - Numbering is historical; x is the reel number, y is cue index
    - start and stop times, in format Hr:Min:Sec:Frame
    - duration
    - notes

- Composing is rough
  - they have [1-2] months to deliver the finished scores
  - release date is fixed; get it done or you'll never work again
  - production phase oft runs overtime; they don't care
  - e.g. in Aliens, some music is duplicated/reused

- [Orchestrators]
  - People skilled in composition, music theory, orchestra knowledge
  - Like the line cooks, or tweeners, of music
  - John Williams' orchestrator: Herbert Spencer
    - Composers yellow sheet music; orchestrators green
    - "My job was copying yellow over to green"
    - Other times... "2m31s waltz"

- [Synth demonstration]
  - Score played with digital instruments for the composer just to make sure
    it's good

- Other roles
  - A [copyist] produces individual sheets of music from the orchestrator's
    score
  - A [music librarian] organizes the parts for recording sessions
  - Conductors and studio musicians (who are good sight readers) are also
    needed
    - Star Wars theme final recording was 5th time; they got rid of preamble at
      the beginning

- Synchronization can be done with click tracks (everyone wears headphones), or
  punches and streamers
    - [Punch]: burst of bright light from the screen seen through peripheral
      vision
      - Used to be done by punching holes in frames
    - [Streamers]: vertical lines that sweep the screen in 2 seconds
      - Used to be done with a yardstick on the film

- Mixing: All music is added up.
- Watched: an extra from Wall-E
- This concludes concepts. Will start history now.

- Screening questions:
- Adventures of Robinhood not on first test.

- Western Classical ("Concert Hall") Music in 12 Minutes
  - Pre-baroque: Weird middle ages stuff
  - [Baroque]: [1600-1750]
    - Composers: Vivaldi, Handel, Bach
    - [Common Practice]: [12 semitone system with major/minor scales]
    - Mathematical
    - Even tempos; consistent (instrument) textures; terraced (discrete step)
      dynamics

      [Bach])
  - [Classical]: [1730-1820]
    - Composers: Mozart, Hayden, Beethoven
    - Greater focus on melody and emotion
      - Big chunky chords with complex melody on top

  - [Romantic]: [1800-1910]
    - Composers: Wagner (!!), Tchaikovsky, Strauss
    - Super feelsy
    - Ended with World War I
    - Listened to: The Magic Fire Music - Die Walkure (1870) (Composer:
      [Wagner])
      - This sounds a lot like film music... because film composers yanked a
        ton from Wagner

- 1800s
  - Much music by Wagner
  - Melodramas (see textbook)

- [The Silent Era]
  - [1895-1927]
  - [The persistence of vision]: The point where you stop seeing separate
    images and start to see continuous motion. About 14 FPS.

- The [Zoopraxiscope] ([1879]) projected moving images on a disk

- [Thomas Edison]
  - A big jerk
  - (Also stole the gramophone)
  - [1891]: Made the [Kinetoscope], a peephole viewer with a continuous loop of
    film
    - the first animated gifs OMG
    - NOT the invention of motion pictures because they were individual
      experiences
  - [1895]: Made the [Kinetophone], a Kinetoscope + Phonograph
  - Problem with synchronization: ???

- [The Lumiere Brothers]
  - Made the first projected film in Paris, [1895 Dec 28]
  - Considered the birth of cinema.
  - Watched: The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat
  - Had live piano accompaniment. Reasons:
    - 1. [Pragmatic. To hide mechanical noise.]
    - 2. [Psychoanalytic. Makes the ghost-like images less disturbing.]
    - 3. [Continuity of tradition: Visual presentations have ALWAYS had music!]
  - Musical accompaniment consisted of:
    - Adaptations of classical music (most popular)
    - Arrangements of popular songs
    - Originally composed music
  - Venues included:
    - Vaudeville theatres, where these were called "[photoplays]" and the
      vaudeville orchestra provided music

- [1905]: [Nickelodeons] were theatres where you could watch films for a
  nickel.
  - You could stay as long as you wanted.
  - Music provided by piano, player piano, ensemble, or gramophone; music still
    not synchronized with film.
  - Grew quickly
    - 1907: 3,000 of them
    - 1910: over 10,000

- [1905-1910]: [Narrative films become a thing.]
  - Music starts to "play the picture"; "fit" and "synchronize".
  - Not original scores yet. Just musicians looking at the film and playing
    appropriate music.

  - Films become longer, deeper.
  - [1912]: The first movie palace is built.
  - Introduction of [theatre organs] with sound effects.
  - [Hollywood]
    - Refused to enforce Thomas Edison's patents.
    - Thus, everyone who wanted to make films went there.

- [1909]: [Edison Film Company] releases "musical suggestions" with each film.

- [1912]: [Max Winkler] of [Carl Fischer Music] suggests specific pieces of
  music with timings.
  - Films shipped with [cue sheets], which might include music
  - One of the first "music fitters".
  - Other thing: [Resource book]

- [Motion Picture World]
  - An industry magazine for filmmaking
  - Had articles and columns about music accompaniment, and made some general
    rules:
    - Music should be continuous
    - Source music is important
    - "Song title" references -- where the only relevant thing is the song
      title -- is bad taste
    - Use of themes
    - Big debate about using "good" (classical) music.
      - Films can expose the common man to great art!

- Mid 19[20]s
  - Filmmakers realized that live performance won't work because:
    - Much variance in performing talent
    - Photo-play musicians felt self-sure
    - Missing cue sheets and scores

- Film: [Birth of a Nation] ([1915])
  - Director: [DW Griffith]
    - Super racist
  - Composer: [Joseph Carl Breil]
  - Initial music fitter: [Carli Elinor]
  - The South are the heroes. The heroes are the KKK.
  - Watched a scene twice.
    - Southern town. War declared; great celebration.
    - Parade, then family goes back in house.
    - First version
      - Small town version.
      - Small competent group of musicians.
      - Parade is exuberant; house is sombre. "Oh no, they're gone now."
    - Second version
      - Big city version.
      - The negative is reversed?
      - Folk song (When Johnny Comes Marching Home) continues into the home.

- Next week: Get rid of the live musicians.

- TEST 1 ENDS HERE

<!-- 2019-01-31 -->

## Week 4

- WHAT WAS THE OPENING MUSIC
  - It was John Powell's soundtrack for How To Train Your Dragon
- Simon is redoing basement -- bad time to have no insulation

- 1922: Earliest demos of sound films with two competing systems.
  - 1. [Sound On Disk]
    - Phonograph synchronized with projector.
    - Good audio quality; bad synchronization.
    - e.g. [Warner Bros]'s [Vitaphone]
      - Huge records
      - Soft material, detailed grooves -- wore out fast (only 20 plays)
  - 2. [Sound On Film]
    - Came out after Sound On Disk
    - Bad audio quality; perfect synchronization.
    - e.g. Phonofilm, Movietone

    - Stored soundtrack, sound effects. No dialog.
  - Recorded score, composed by [William Axt], performed by NY Philharmonic

    - First film with full synchronized dialogue, but there's only a bit of it
  - Star: [Al Jolson] (think Lady Gaga)
  - Had some compiled score from [Tchaikovsky (Romeo and Juliet)]
  - Silent staring accommodates record switching machine
  - Awful dialogue. Who got paid for writing it? No one! Scriptwriters weren't
    a thing yet. Dialogue was improvised.
    - All these things we take for granted / These things are just about to be
      invented
  - Most people still didn't see the film with Vitaphone
  - Massive financial success

- Early 19[30]s: Sound on Film's audio quality improved and it took over
  - Sound films were much more expensive to make
  - Silent films often didn't care about extraneous sounds, such as cueing the
    actors

- [The Studio System]
  - Departmentalized production style used during [1930s-50s]
  - Movie studios buy each other up:
    - The Big Five: [MGM], [Paramount], [Warner Bros], [20th Century Fox]
      (1935), [RKO]
    - The Little Three: Universal, Columbia, United Artists

    - was not possible for a while due to technology limitations
  - All sound had to be recorded in real time
    - Cameras put in large soundproof booths, which prevents movement
    - Musicians had to be on set

- Studio System - Showing films
  - Too many contesting sound systems
  - [1929]: 1000/20000 theatres equipped for sound

  - Qualifications neither necessary nor useful; it's all nepotism and
    connections lol
  - If you do a good job, word gets around about you

- Test 1
  - 55 minutes
  - Multiple choice
  - Not in here; tests in here are more like group research projects
  - Covers everything up to last week; study guide to be posted
  - Everything's up. Films, dates, names all included.

- Film: [Cimarron] ([1931])
  - Composed by [Max Steiner]
  - Ordinary film

  - Simple leitmotif for Kong: He's a force of nature; doesn't think.
  - Watched: King Kong - The Fog - Going Ashore
    - Score comes in as the ship reaches the fog bank.
    - Music starts when we enter the supernatural.
    - Flirting between consonance and dissonance creates a sense of [mystery]
    - Instrument: [Harp] is associated with the fantastic
    - Return of the Jedi: Harp plays Darth Vader's theme as he dies
    - Blurry line between diegetic music and score -- uncertain if actors can
      hear the music

    - Young lady prepared for unpleasant end
    - Tuba synchronized with chief's footsteps
      - Mickey Mousing
  - Considered to have reintroduced original, non-diegetic music into sound
    films.

<!-- 2018-02-07 -->

## Week 5

- There was one question where it asked how we discussed this one guy who I
  didn't recognize. Z. W. something. Trying to remember, but I forgot the full
  name immediately after standing up.
  - 1913 book
- Overall: anything I did study I perhaps overstudied. But there were bits and
  pieces that I missed completely. Should take more comprehensive notes.
  Concepts are easy; names and years are brutal.
  - another thing I got wrong: the music editor is the one who provides the cue
    sheet (not the music supervisor)

- Simon takes pictures of lightning
- Simon uses GIMP

      - Wrote 20th Century Fox fanfare
      - Randy Newman also a big deal (Pixar)
    - [Herbert Stothart]
      - Composed for The Wizard of Oz (1939); won Oscar that way

- [Erich Wolfgang Korngold]
  - 1897-1957
  - Born 1897 in Vienna.
  - "Wolfgang": Named after Mozart.
  - Child prodigy, son of music critic (literary, not bashing).
  - Taught by [Richard Strauss] and [Gustav Mahler].
    - (Strauss's music was used for 2001: A Space Odyssey)
  - [1934]: Involved in Felix Mendelssohn's "A Midsummer Night's Dream"
    - This Shakespeare play has a lot of songs
    - Music for those songs was long lost
    - Writing music for this play is a common challenge for composers
    - This version widely considered the best.
  - Asked to supervise for a movie adaptation
    - But sees himself as an Euro-art-music composer. Does not want to be a
      movie composer. Turns down all studio contracts.
    - Entered agreement with Warner Brothers to come back every year or so and
      do a film if he wants. (One of very few to work freelance, not sign a
      full-time contract.)

- Film: [Anthony Adverse] ([1936])
  - About orphan in debt with a crush
  - Music written by [Erich Korngold]
  - Won Academy Award

- [Erich Korngold] (cont.)
  - [1938]: Max Steiner was head of music at Warner Bros, but his style wasn't
    appropriate for Robin Hood. So [Erich Korngold] was asked to do it, but he
    refused. "No. I don't do action films."
    - On way back: Receives a telegram. "The Nazis have invaded Austria."
    - Erich Korngold was Jewish. "Everything we own is gone."
    - And so, Korngold accepts Robin Hood and relocates permanently to
      Hollywood.
    - Robin Hood: Got Academy Award. Award given to Korngold himself, not the
      head of the music department.

- [Erich Korngold] (cont.)
  - [1957]: Tried to restart his concert hall career. Didn't work out --
    concert hall music had moved on to modernism and atonality.
  - Quite depressed for last few years.
  - Composed only [19] film scores in 12 years.
  - Influential because he brought the Viennese style directly to Hollywood,
    not filtered through Broadway.

- [Erich Korngold] (cont.)
  - Style was [19th century Romantic]. Approached movies as operas without
    signing.
    - Focused on extended melodies.
    - [Phrased] the drama.
  - Developed the model for battle scenes:
    - Loud dynamics
    - Rapid scale passages
      - All musicians practice scales for thousands of hours
      - (As opposed to a random melody: The musicians would have looked at it
        and gone "what the fuck")
      - Quick way of creating a lot of energy with little practice
    - Irregular, aggressive accents
    - Occasional leitmotif reference
  - Used the [overture] to present the main themes.

- Film: [The Sea Hawk] ([1940])
  - Composed by [Erich Korngold]
  - Basically the same crew as [Robin Hood]
  - Set in 1500s, when Spain had a massive navy (The Spanish Armada) and
    England was in trouble. England only had small, agile ships. So the queen
    ordered the agile ships (called Sea Hawks) to go out in groups and pick out
    lone ships.
  - Extended themes
  - Battle scene music
  - Watched: Opening credits.
    - Uses an [overture]. Three sections: heroic / love / heroic.
    - ABA structure.
    - Heroic theme: uses brass fanfare to convey nobility and heroism. Precise
      timing.
    - Love theme: uses strings. Variable tempo, because that's emotional.
  - Watched: Battle scene.
    - Good example of Korngold's battle music.
    - [Harp]: Very good at scale runs. Pedals let you key change.
    - [Phrases] the drama. Sets the mood and parallels the battle.
    - Quietens under dialog. Hits the thrown knife. Drops pacing under the
      retreat.
      - Sustained notes hold moments of expectation.
    - Blending between source and score.
      - Different from Steiner; Steiner didn't know where the lines should be.
        Korngold thought about it very carefully.
      - Brass overtone limitation exploited for [operatic] effect.

- Film: [The Adventures of Robin Hood] ([1938])
  - Composed by [Erich Korngold]
  - In colour, which is a big deal.
    - Technology was there, but wasn't super quickly adopted.
    - Black and white sometimes preferred: allowed photographers to flex their
      shadow-finding skills
  - Watched: Opening credits
    - Overture.
    - Three themes.
    - 1 & 2: Variations on each other. Almost sounds light, goofy. Not
      extremely heroic. You might assume it's Robin Hood's theme, but it's not.
      It's a [march]: a group activity. It's the theme for the Merry Men, the
      collective.
      - When Robin Hood does things by himself, he messes up. Deer: almost gets
        killed. Archery tournament: gets caught.
    - 3: Love theme. Strings. Uses ascending [6th] interval: one of the most
      common opening intervals for love themes. (John Williams also used many
      sixths).
      - Transitions into the first scene diegetically with the timpani drums.

- The French horn looks like a bowl of spaghetti

- Tests to be marked within a week.

<!-- 2019-02-14 -->

## Week 6

- Sorry I didn't mark the tests
- It's because Tuesday was cancelled

- Robin Hood Scene 2: [Saxons in Peril] (2)
  - Has a short [montage] of the saxons being persecuted.
  - "Saxons in Peril" theme sounds like a cry or plea. Often heard when we
    see Saxons persecuted. Great example of [descriptive] music.
  - Robin Hood theme plays when he first shows up. Is a short, awkward
    [fanfare]. Not present in opening credits.

- Robin Hood Scene 3: [Little John]
  - Little John whistling
  - Theme is used when main characters join the merry men.
  - First heard with Little John - French Horn. Provides an operatic link to
    the hunter/woodsman.
  - Stylistic blend of source music.
  - [Hits] the action during the duel.
    - Korngold DOES NOT Mickey Mouse... except for comedy.
      - Makes it clear that the duel is not serious.
    - Also, strings match when Will Scarlet plays the lute
  - When Robin takes bow out, Korngold suspends the music.
  - "Water" theme is similar to opera.
    - Moving water is depicting using [woodwind] instruments trilling.
  - Concludes with the Merry Men theme.
  - No Robin Hood theme.

- Robin Hood Scene 4: [Friar Tuck]
  - Similar to Little John scene.
  - Friar Tuck has his own theme too.
  - Played using [bassoon] and muted [trumpet] for comedy and personality.
    - bassoon is like a giant oboe
    - trumpet uses mute to dullen the sound
  - Sword fight uses the Little John battle theme again, but more
    exciting/worrisome with swords.
  - Woodwind "water" theme again.
  - No Robin Hood theme.

- Robin Hood Scene 5: [Marion and Robin] 1
  - Robin "kidnaps" Marion in woods
  - Quiet variation of Saxons in Peril theme, as Marion sees the Saxons.
    - An instance of [thematic transformation].
    - Invokes memory of persection.
  - Turns out there are two love themes.
  - Love Theme 1: A love theme that also starts with a sixth.
  - Love Theme 2: The same love theme from opening credits.
  - Also contains the First Smooch (Simon's wording)

- Robin Hood Scene 6: [Marion and Robin] 2
  - In Marion's bedroom
  - Love Theme 1: For the Big Smooch.
    - Has big strings. Moment of spectacle.
  - Love Theme 2: More intimate.
    - Instrument: A quiet [cello].
    - Solo instrument is more intimate.

- Robin Hood Scene 7: [King Richard reveal]
  - To determine the purpose of a theme, find where it is played the most
    definitively.
  - This scene is where it happens for Love Theme 2.
  - So why two love themes?
    - Love Theme 1 is about [romantic love].
    - Love Theme 2 is about [love of country].
  - The message to the film: In order to get things done in hard times, we have
    to work together. A message of the collective.
    - Important message in 1938, because it was right at the end of the Great
      Depression.
    - Many films had this message. The collective will solve the problem.
      Individuals cause problems.

- [The Sea Hawk] (cont.)
  - It was released in 1940 -- the same time as The Battle of Britain.
  - Germans used Blitzkrieg. British and French armies driven into the sea at
    Dunkirk.
  - Simon's grandfather knew Dunkirk men. Utter silence on the beaches.
  - The Royal Air Force were the only ones keeping the Britains in the game.
  - "Never in the course of human conflict have so many owed so much to so
    few."
  - Before film, cast stated "we hope you find inspiration."

- In the future, they will study how superhero films became a big deal after
  [September 11, 2001].

- [Erich Korngold] (cont.)
  - Long and involved themes.
  - Themes often unfold without distortion.
  - Hits the action for [comedy], or [key moments of drama].
  - Occasional mickey mousing for comedy.

- The Great Depression
  - [1930s]
  - Films were spectacular and escapist.
  - Films include:
    - [The Adventures of Robin Hood] (1938)
      - We watched it
    - [Lost Horizon] (1937)
      - Composed by [Dimitri Tiomkin]

        utopia from which they can never leave.
    - [The Wizard of Oz] (1939)
      - Composed by [Herbert Stothart]
      - Interesting sepia to color transition

- [1940s]
  - People gradually became interested in more realistic stories, in contrast
    to fantastic/escapist Depression-era films.
  - Black&white morality makes way for grey.
  - Films characterized by:
    - Psychological drama
    - Complex motivations
    - Character driven narrative
  - Explores the dark&edgy side of the human condition.
    - Themes: Jealousy; greed.
  - Not seen in Western Europe during WWII. Films sent over by USA as part of
    rebuilding. Really shocks the French; "mon dieu! these films, they are so
    dark! they are black! they are..."
    - [Film Noir].
  - Influenced by German [Expressionism]
    - German film aesthetic that developed in 19[20]s.
    - Deals with alienation; madness
    - Sets were claustrophobic and surreal
    - German film directors fleeing the Nazis brought this over to Hollywood.
  - Many American-born film composers too:

  - [1942]: Scored Jungle Book.

- Film: [The Thief of Bagdad] ([1940])

  - Originally produced in Europe; moved to USA because Europe became a bad
    place to work on films

    elderly man; meets miserable scheming trophy wife. Salesman l000<3ves!!
    wife, huge insurance payout. Claims adjuster named Keyes... might solve it?
  - it's not a whodunit. we know who dunit; we saw them dunit!
  - Music:
    - Short, dissonant themes are unpredictable, unsettling, uncertain.
    - Less clear tonality.
  - Watched: Scene about 2/3 through.
    - First part: [No score] causes unbearable tension.
    - A pullback from wall-to-wall music. Composers begin to use silence.

- Film: [Spellbound] ([1945])
- Film: [The Lost Weekend] ([1945])
  - Composer: [Miklos Rosza]
  - Both nominated for Academy Awards. Spellbound won one; Rosza disappointed
    because he preferred the other.
  - Both Film Noir, psychological, disturbed characters.
  - Both used the [theremin].
    - Electronic instrument with eerie, ghostly sound.
    - Depicts psychological instability.
    - (10 years ago, every engineer was getting mail-order theremins.)
  - First use of electronic instrument in a film score.

- Film: [The Lost Weekend] ([1945])
  - Composer: [Miklos Rosza]
  - Film Noir.
  - About alcoholism. Treats it seriously, which was iconoclastic for the time.
  - Guy and girlfriend. Want to go to cottage; no, work on book; also an
    alcoholic. Over weekend, alcoholism degenerates and he is Lost.
  - Everyone laughed at the alcoholic. Until Rosza's score.
  - Used [theremin] to reify the alcoholism.
  - Mostly tonal, but alcoholic scenes become very atonal.
  - [Watched]: Bar scene (part 1)
    - Begins with positive urgency.
    - Tonal/romantic music with mention of Helen.
    - Comic/uncertain as he fumbles with hat and cigarette.

  - [Watched]: Bar scene (part 2)
    - The dude stole adjacent woman's purse.
    - Only source music.
    - Here, we see Burnham from the exterior. Music would add drama, but
      without it, he appears pathetic and small.
    - Consonant sound of popular music contrasts with the dissonance of
      Burnham's theme.
    - Once he's been kicked out, the score comes back. Figure and ground.

    - Charlie Chaplin was a talented self-taught musician, but could not write
      music notation.

- Film: [Laura] ([1944])
  - Composer: [David Raksin]
  - Director: [Otto Preminger]
  - Director wanted score based off [Sophisticated Lady] by [Duke Ellington]
    - Was popular music (jazz/BigBand)
    - Director may have misinterpreted real meaning -- lyrics were ironic.
  - [David Raksin] says "I'll come up with a theme!"
    - Got nothing Fri, Sat, ...
    - Checks mail. Letter from wife, a travelling performer. Letter says: "Dear
      Dave; I met someone else, let's divorce. - Your Soon-to-be ex-wife".
    - And so inspiration strikes and the theme is made.
  - Is a psy[chological thriller] -- it's a "who done it?"
  - Film Noir depends greatly on tension between characters, motivations, and
    misdirection.
  - Film is [monothematic]: it is based on a single theme for Laura.
    - Other semi-themes and textures exist, but a single theme dominates.
  - Based on American popular music, rather than European classical music.
  - Music does not drive suspense. Rather, it is like the ghost or "ideal" of
    Laura as the characters discuss her.
  - Gives insight into McPherson's mind:
    - McPherson eventually loooo♥ves her!

## Week 7

- Sad news: André Previn has died.

- Laura: Scene 1: [Opening credits and monologue]
  - Opening credits:
    - Focus on the portrait of Laura. She's a sophisticated urban woman; almost
      unearthly, ethereal.
    - Then music starts, linking the musical theme to Laura.
    - Music is orchestral, but influenced by pop/jazz.
    - Trumpet has very wide vibrato. Very non-classical playing style.
    - Lyrics were added to the main theme. This was a major pop hit.
      - Decision made to release solo track AFTER the film was a big hit.
    - At the end of the credits, the music does not [resolve].
  - Monologue:
    - These were common in [Film Noir].
    - Throughout, music has a [pedal point]: sustained bass note under moving
      chord. (Similar to a drone, except you expect a pedal point to change.)
    - This monologue is [metadiegetic]. On the boundary of life and death,
      between the film world and the audience.
    - As the music ends, the first instance of diegetic dialog happens and we
      transition into the narrative. "Careful there. That stuff is priceless."

- Laura: Scene 2/3: [Lydecker's story]
  - In restaurant, musicians are playing Laura's theme as [source] music.
    - Musicians' instruments weren't real. Was "lipsyncing" in reverse. Score
      was matched pretty well to theme.
  - With Lydecker's story, it transitions into score.
    - Laura is supposed to look "very suburban and slightly frumpy."
  - Dialog between Lydecker and Laura:
    - Lydecker is super fussy. Messes with food in the greatest restaurant.
    - Lydecker really gets under Laura's skin.
    - All the while, Laura's theme is gone and replaced with a [waltz].
    - Meaning: This isn't the real Laura. This is Laura putting on an act to
      entice Lydecker.
    - Laura's theme comes in when the pretense is dropped. "You really believe
      that?"
  - She's younger than us; he's older than Simon. It's Creepy!
  - Lydecker's praise:
    - Oh yes Laura was great yada yada.
    - Candle is much shorter: Shows time passeed.
    - Music transitions back and forth from source to score.
    - "She listened in a way that's more eloquent than speech."
      - My perfect woman shuts up and listens.
    - I can read my articles to you~~!!
    - Laura is the pinnacle of his collection.

- Laura: Scene 4: [McPherson searches Laura's apartment.]
  - Music follows McPherson's internal state and he searches the apartment.
  - Music is connected to the portrait.
  - Laura's theme calms him down.
  - [Hitting the action]: Happens when McPherson turns on a light.
  - [Wobbly piano]: Piano was recorded on wire film. One of the guide reels was
    replaced with an elliptical wheel, creating synthetic vibrato.
    - First time we've encountered [electronic manipulation].

- Laura: Scene 5: [McPherson falls asleep.]
  - This is why Laura is [monothematic]. This is what you have been set up for.
  - Unresolved chord when [McPherson falls asleep].
  - And then Laura comes back.
  - And the rest of the scene is silent.
    - The music is for [the idealized Laura].
    - The real Laura has no music. She's completely different. Normal, flawed.
    - And the rest of film [has basically no Laura theme].
      - Characterization is established and overturned.
  - McPherson steps in front of the portrait.

- TEST 2 ENDS HERE

- [1950]s
  - [The End of the Studio System].
    - After WWII, the government had more free time on their hands.
    - USA broke up the studios using [antitrust].
    - Thus began the [Independent Film Industry].
  - New Media: Television.
    - Hollywood dictated that films shall never be shown on TVs.
  - Two fronts to fight TV: [Technology and subject matter].

- Fighting TV with technology
  - Hollywood accelerates the move to all colour movies.
  - Hollywood experiments with various systems to create a wide-screen image.
    (Up to now, all films were 4:3.)
  - Multiple systems include [Cinerama], [CinemaScope], [VistaVision]
  - Multi-channel sound systems.

- Fighting TV with subject matter
  - [1930 March]: The [Hays Code]/Production Code is created. Is voluntary.
    Forbids nudity, sex outside of marriage, crime, bed unless both had at
    least one foot on floor
  - [1934]: Hays Code becomes mandatory, because theatres only showed code
    movies.
    - Gone with the Wind (1939) was hit by this code. They spent an hour
      shooting the "I don't give a damn" scene to replace damn. Fined $10K.
  - [1940s]: Films push the code with Film Noir.
  - [1950s]: Films shatter the code and bring the film world revolution.
  - TV content is more restricted to appease advertisers.
  - Foreign films were not restricted by Hays Code.
  - [1968]: Hays Code totally abandoned.

- Big Epic Films:
  - Quo Vadis, The Robe, Julius Caesar, Lawrence of Arabia,
    Cleopatra, The Ten Commandments
  - aka "[Sword and Sandal films]"

- Film: [Ben-Hur] ([1959])
  - Biblical story about prince of Judea who fights Roman childhood friend.
  - Watched: The Chariot Race Parade
    - Composed by [Miklos Rosza]
      - Three periods of Rosza: Fantasy, Film Noir, Historical Epics
    - A bit of stylistic source music, then back to score.
    - We've been watching this film for two minutes and nothing has happened.
    - This scene's entire purpose was to be... spectacular.

- [Elmer Bernstein]
  - 1922-2004
  - Born in [New York City]
  - Went to [Julliard] and studied with [Aaron Copland] and Roger Sessions
    - The highest standard of classical education.
    - Aaron Copland: American composer who revolutionizes film scoring as a
      teacher.
  - [1940s]: Pursued career as a classical pianist/composer.
  - [1940s]: Also, worked in Armed Forces radio during the war.
  - [1952]: First film work. Promising career for about 10 months...
  - [1953]: [HUAC. ( house unamerican activities committee )]
    - The Americans need someone who they are not. Drugs, poverty, race, ...
      The Soviet Union. COMMUNISM. The New Enemy.
    - Communists lurking in the shadows.
    - Hollywood crawling with lefty liberals.
    - Elmer Bernstein wrote a record review, stolen by a communist newspaper
    - Thus he was wiped out.
    - Started to work in B-movies.
      - Drive-thrus, drive-in movies become a big thing because America wants
        to do everything in their car.
      - Teenagers could go to drive-in movies and have some private time in the
        car.
      - Good films like Ben-Hur were called "A-picture"s.
      - To fill out the evening for the teens, second crappy movie: the
        "B-movie".

- Film: [Cat Woman on the Moon] ([1953])
  - Composer: [Elmer Bernstein]
  - B-movie.

- Film: [The Man With The Golden Arm] ([1955])
  - Pushes the Hays Code.
  - Still black and white.
  - Golden Arm Man:
    - Jazz drummer.
    - Dealer for high-stakes illegal poker. Goes to jail for this.
    - Heroin addict. Arm full of high-price drug.
  - Music:
    - Ensemble is a [Jazz Big Band].
    - Score is very jazz-influenced.
    - Hollywood convention: Jazz music, the music of the urban centre, is
      drugs.
    - Example of an attempt to use a popular style in film score. Effective for
      the most part, but awkward at times because pop music is consistent.
  - Watched: Scene
    - Lots of [phrasing the drama]
    - Then, extreme [hitting the action]
      - BANG with each thing taken out of the drawer.
      - Really doesn't work with pop music.
      - That's why most pop music in films even now is source music, or montage
        score.
  - Flexibility becomes an important skill for film composers.

- Film: [The Ten Commandments] ([1956])
  - Director: [Cecil B. de Mille]
  - Composer: [Elmer Bernstein]
    - Elmer Bernstein found work as a rehearsal pianist for a ballet company.
    - Met [Agnes de Mille].
    - Main composer got ill.
    - Agnes de Mille's brother, [Cecil B. de Mille], had to replace the composer
      on really short notice.
    - So [Elmer Bernstein] came on board.
    - Notable because it constrasts with his previous work.

- [Dimitri Tiomkin]
  - 1894-1979
  - Born in [Russia].
  - Played piano in Russian silent movie theatres.
  - [1925]: Came to USA and worked in vaudeville.

    - [It's A Wonderful Life] ([1946])

- Film: [High Noon] ([1952])
  - A western.
  - Composer: [Dimitri Tiomkin]
  - Film is shot in just about real time. Sheriff is getting married. Telegram
    arrives; a man the sheriff put in jail has been freed. "What I get out, I'm
    coming back here and I'm gonna kill you." Will arrive on the noon train.
    Townspeople abandon the sheriff.
  - Score based on pop song composed by Dimitri Tiomkin: "[Do Not Forsake Me]".
    - (aka The Ballad of High Noon)
  - Song [prereleased]: released before the film.
    - Hit for singer [Tex Ritter].
    - Established the use of "[Movie Songs]".
  - Academy Award for best score and best song.
  - Listened to: [Do Not Forsake Me]
    - Written by Dimitri Tiomkin
    - Two themes
  - Watched: Scene before Frank Miller's train arrives.
    - Can see that director gave the composer more free reign.
    - Scene edited in two second cuts.
    - Sheriff writes out his will. Looks up and sees the clock. Clock ticks
      become the tempo of the music.
    - Like a theatrical [tableau] (actors hold a pose).
      - Bouncing theme from song sounds now sounds menacing.

<!-- 2019-03-07 -->

## Week 8

- Country & Western:
  - Country is American southeast.

  - Western developed because of Hollywood cowboy movies.

- [Bernard Herrmann]
  - 1911-1975
  - Born in [New York City]

    - Radio was established at the time.
    - Opportunities to write background music for radio shows.
    - Very successful, well respected.
    - Learns to write music [on demand very fast].
    - Learns to write for [weird combinations of instruments].
  - Later, worked for the [Mercury Players].
    - Owned by [Orson Wells].
    - [1938 Oct]: Live radio play adaptation of [The War of the Worlds] by
      [H.G. Wells] (no relation).
    - Presented the play as a series of news bulletins.
    - If you tuned in after the opening credits, you would be fake newsed.
    - Known as [The Night that Panicked America].
    - Lots of attention for [Orson Wells]. Hollywood wants him.
    - But he wanted too much creative control.
  - [1940]: Travels to Hollywood with Orson Wells.
  - [1941]: Did Citizen Kane.
  - [1951]: Did The Day the Earth Stood Still

- [Orson Wells]
  - Owner of the [Mercury Players].

- Film: [Citizen Kane] ([1941])
  - Directed/produced/starred by [Orson Wells]
  - Composed by [Bernard Herrmann]
  - Watched: Breakfast montage
    - Two passionate lovebirds become hostile after years.
    - All of it is done at the breakfast table.
    - Very [operatic] -- could have been written by Korngold.
      - Bernard Herrmann was clearly classical.
    - Music goes from playful to edgy to dark to empty.
    - Beginning of scene: Table is small and they are corner sitting!! cute!
    - End of scene: Table is long and they are sitting opposite each other.

- The Simpsons references Citizen Kane and Planet of the Apes a lot.

- Film: [The Day the Earth Stood Still] ([1951])
  - Composed by [Bernard Herrmann]
  - About an alien spacecraft who lands on Earth; nervous about Earth's nuclear
    weapons; threatens to sterilize planet if Earth doesn't clean up their act.
  - Very unusual selection of instruments: 1 violin, 1 cello, 3 electric bass,
    2 theremins, 3 electric organs, 3 vibraphones, 2 glockenspiels, 2 pianos
    (one prepared), 2 harps, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, 4 tubas.
  - Watched: Alien shows up
    - The music is very non-operatic.
    - Uses [sound clouds]: a group of instruments sustains a collection of
      notes, drifting toward dissonance and atonality.
      - Creates a lot of [anticipation].
      - Makes the music very distinct.
    - Tension ends when Alien's tube goes spiky and gunshot.
    - (is a variation on cycle of fifths, but the rabble wouldn't get it)
  - Watched: Gort
    - Gort is an unstoppable relentless weapon.
    - Music comes back in a relentless drive when Gort shows up.
  - Bernard Herrmann's greatest contribution:
    - Why do people write music for symphony orchestras, instead of for 30
      ocarinas and underarm farts?
      - Because they exist. That's their point. They're a meme.
    - Bernard Herrmann realizes that film score only needs to be performed and
      recorded once. Timbre and instrument set become differentiators.

- [Alfred Hitchcock]
  - 1955: Begins collaborating with [Bernard Herrmann]
  - 1958: They make [Vertigo]
  - 1959: They make [North By Northwest]
  - [Auteur]: Dictatorial artistic control over film with distinct style.
  - 1960: [Psycho].

- Film: [Psycho] ([1960])
  - Director: [Alfred Hitchcock]
  - Composer: [Bernard Herrmann]
  - Rumor: Originally intended for TV? (nope false)
  - Limited budget.
    - Hitchcock was a big deal, but demanding; he pissed off everyone. A true
      fountainhead.
    - 4:3 instead of widescreen: less common these days.
    - Black and white.
  - Score is only strings.
    - Strings section is most flexible in the orchestra. Can get warmth,
      romance, power, coldness. Many playing techniques.
  - Cues set a single mood. Respond little to what happens minute by minute.
    - Does not hit the action.
    - Does not phrase the drama.
    - Basically [plays the drama].
  - Music is very bleak throughout. You expect respite and get nothing.

- Midterm 2
  - The Frankenstein Chronicles is good. Has good music too. Hammer dulcimer.
  - Not cumulative.
  - Last topic is Laura.
  - Has a lot more history. Less introductory concepts.
  - Nail the films, composers, dates.
  - Film bits: Limited to that discussed in class.

- Psycho: Scene 1: [The Money]
  - Short repetitive theme fractures.
  - Towards [atonality].
  - Quiet, unsettled. Reflects Marion's discomfort with the theft.
  - Becomes a bit more intense when she takes the money.
  - [Ostinato]: Repeating pattern in melody, like a static background.
  - Hitchcock's voyeurism shows. Things are very close to the camera.
  - [Vibrato] is totally absent, sucking out all the warmth.

- Psycho: Scene 2: [Flight]
  - Plays as Marion makes an "escape".
  - This scene: Marion trades in her car.
  - Doubles as the opening credits theme.
  - More ostinato.
  - "Stop!" -- Music stops, leaving you in suspense.
  - At first, seems to play at her fear of being caught...
  - But as she changes, music plays her fall to the dark side.
    - Yeah I'm badass. Gleam in eye. Corner of lip turns up. Terrifying
      expression.
    - Music doesn't change.

- Aside: Psycho
  - Has two stories, pretty much.
  - Based on a book.
  - Hitchcock bought out copies of the book to prevent people from reading the
    book before seeing the film.

- Psycho: Scene 3: [Norman]
  - Norman's theme: [Minor second] intervals played at a variety of pitches.
    - Thus no sense of major or minor scale.
    - No clarity. Unsettling because you can't pin it down.
  - Marion decides to return the money, and then...
  - Norman spies on Marion
    - Violin [harmonics] as Norman spies on Marion. No emotion.
    - Very high pitched, vibrato impossible
    - Norman's lack of emotion while spying is more disturbing than sexual deviancy.
  - Hitchcock's voyeurism again. Norman's eyeball.

- Psycho: Scene 4: Arbogast's Murder
  - don't worry about it - Simon

- Psycho: Scene 5: [The Shower]
  - Story changes from Marion to murder mystery.
  - Stories from production
    - Hitchcock deliberately made the rest of the film a lot racier so censors
      would miss the shower scene.
    - Censor viewers were convinced they saw full nudity. But there is none.
    - After receiving censor feedback, sent back identical film in 3 days. That
      was okay apparently
    - Hitchcock was disappointed with progress. The team told Hitchcock to
      clear his head out of town. "all right." But remember, Bernie: No music
      on the shower scene. > Ok let's record the music for the shower scene.
    - (female star) got really pruney because she was in the shower for 3 days.
    - Hitchcock hears music. Everyone waiting for Hitchcock to explode. "You
      okay with that?" "mmm phh"
  - No music until the murderer pulls back the shower curtain.
  - No tonality. Strings shriek.
    - Extremely aggressive bowing at a high pitch.
    - Violins distort like crazy at high volume.
  - Many many different shots.
  - As murderer runs away: IT'S NORMAN'S THEME

- The fall of Bernard Herrmann
  - Due to [The Beatles], pop music becomes massively profitable.
  - Hollywood takes notice of the New Paradigm: rock and roll.
  - But Herrmann HATED pop music.
  - Hitchcock wanted to do film [Torn Curtain].
    - Herrmann did no pop. Big fight, Herrmann walked out.
    - And they basically never talked again.

- Film: [Fahrenheit 451] ([1966])
  - Composer: [Bernard Herrmann]
  - Director: François Truffaut
  - Bernard Herrmann moves back to Europe bitterly.

- Film: [Taxi Driver] ([1975])
  - Composer: [Bernard Herrmann]
  - Was Bernard Herrmann's last film.
  - Died in his sleep of a heart attack.

- Key Word: [Versatility]
  - To be a successful film composer, you must be able to write in a variety of
    styles.
  - The end of the Studio System leads to [freelancing].

- [1960]s
  - By now, the Studio System is pretty much dead.
  - A turbulent time in American history.
    - [Civil rights] movement
    - Generational gap. Young people called [baby boomers] are now young
      adults and wanted to revolutionize the world.
  - Films:
    - Early decade: Still sword-and-sandal epics like the previous decade.
    - As baby boomers grow up, this changes.
  - ~[1965]: The Production Code is abandoned.
  - Films become more explicit in subjects, visuals, dialog.
  - ~[1968]: Films with more irony and cynicism.
  - The rise of independent production
    - Costs escalated, since there was no more Studio System keeping costs under
      control.
    - Scores: Smaller ensembles and popular music are favored over orchestras.
  - Change of the old guard.
    - Max Steiner, Thomas Newman, and Dimitrio Tiomkin are OUT
    - [Jerry Goldsmith] becomes a big deal
  - The Second Wave of European Composers
    - [Maurice Jarre] (French)
    - [John Barry] (English)
    - [Ennio Morricone] (Italian)

<!-- 2019-03-14 -->

# Week 9

- Did Test 2. I feel like I studied the wrong things in depth. There was only
  like, one "what composer" or "what year" question -- the rest was
  understanding concepts, which I kind of hoped that I would just intuit but I
  guess not.

- Netflix has a 10 part series on Formula One

- [Ennio Morricone]
  - Born 1928 in Rome, Italy.
  - Won Academy Award after receiving "consolation" Lifetime Achievement Award
  - TODO: awful film he did
  - Best known for association with [Sergio Leone] (spaghetti westerns)
  - Over 400 film credits

- [Spaghetti westerns]
  - Westerns shot in Spain
  - Cast many italians, plus a couple Americans as the stars

  - Multifaceted characters like Film Noir
  - Reflects 1960s relooking at history

- Film: [The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly] (1966)
  - Composer: [Ennio Morricone]
  - Story: The Good arranged with The Ugly (who is wanted) to collect bounty
    while saving him at the last moment. The Bad...
  - Listened to: Very iconic music.
  - Interesting instruments. Used sound effects, voices, and electric guitar
    - Electric guitar because The Beatles.

- [John Barry]
  - Played piano classically, and trumpet
  - Turned to pop in his 20s
    - Friend in the film industry had trouble with composer
    - Asked to quickly conjure up some music ideas
  - Won 5 academy awards, including Born Free (1967), Out of Africa (1986),
    Dances with Wolves (1991)
  - Style: Clear, simple, tonal melodies.
  - Pop influenced.
  - Used [block orchestration]: Separate rhythm, melody, and chord parts but
    otherwise homogenous blocks. Makes the sound less busy.
  - Grand use of strings and brass.

- Film: [Dr. No] ([1962])
  - First James Bond film
  - Music fades out whenever it's no longer needed.
  - Composed by [John Barry]...
    - Original composer [Monty Norman]
    - Due to contract, Monty Norman was credited as the composer while John
      Barry was only credited as an arranger.
    - "James Bond theme by Monty Norman used with permission"
    - More than $3M in royalties, even though he didn't write it
    - John Barry sued Monty Norman
    - Monty Norman won; had produced musical that uses the theme

- Film: [Out of Africa] (1986)
  - Composed by [John Barry]
  - Watched: Theme.

- The start of modernism
  - Ennio Morricone and John Barry both demonstrate the growth of pop in film
    music.
  - Avant-garde is also becoming more influential. Atonal.
    - Avant-garde artists usually not popular; too far over the edge.
  - [Modern]ism: The rejection of the past in favour of the new.
    - Moving from "realism" to "abstract".

- Film: [2001: A Space Odyssey] ([1968]) (again)
  - Compiled score from classical music
  - Seen as an approach to the relationship between music and film.
    - Would approach work in more conventional films?
  - Combines:
    - Late-19th century tonal (like Johann Strauss II)
      - Well-known tune: Blue Danube Waltz
    - Atonal music from the 20th century (Gyorgy Ligeti)
      - extremely dense
  - Watched: From the earth to the moon
    - Music dominates throughout. No other sound.
    - Set built on a big spinner.
    - Blue Danube Waltz represents us.
    - Ligeti represents the alien civilization.
      - Everything about the piece is alien, except the voices. The voice
        conveys a presence.
  - Stanley Kubrick wanted to use original recordings; studio warned it would
    be way too expensive.
    - Alex North presented to him.
    - 2 weeks before release date: Kubrick says "ok fine" and Alex North writes
      music from 10pm to 6am, then supervises during the day for 8 days
      straight.
    - North taken out of hotel on a stretcher; had to be rehydrated in hospital.
    - All of his music was obliterated.
    - Kubrick: I DESTROYED ALL THE TAPES. I BURNED ALL THE SHEET MUSIC.
    - Ligeti asked for $$$$$$
    - Alex North never spoke of this for the rest of his life.
    - To Jerry Goldsmith: "I want to hear about 2001."
    - "Play him the cassette tape." <-- containing all the original music!
    - All of the music was later recorded by Goldsmith.

<!-- 2019-03-21 -->

# Week 10

- Past 15 years: Test 2 average has been 78±1%. Your average was 75%. So the
  final will has some fun questions.
- When I use the word "professor" the real professors get grumpy
- I'm just a sessional lecturer / adjunct faculty.

- Jerry Goldsmith
  - 1929-2004
  - Born in [Los Angeles]
  - Studied film composition with [Miklos Rosza] at USC
  - Came out of television.

- Note the progression of film composer breeding grounds:
  - Opera
  - Broadway
  - Radio
  - Television
  - Now: Video games

- Film: [Patton] ([1970])
  - Composer: [Jerry Goldsmith]
  - Deals with WWII. Biopic about George Patton, successful general.
  - Takes a more balanced look at the war.
    - Nobody sees themselves as the bad guy in a war. The Nazis speak German.
  - Less than 40 minutes of score for a 3 hour film.
  - Music focuses on Patton's character.
  - Uses electronic processing on orchestral instruments.
  - Jerry Goldsmith's philosophy: Write as little music as possible. Do as
    little emotional manipulation as possible.
  - Theme: March.
    - Tonal, major. No modernism at all.
  - Theme: Religious.
    - Protestant hymn. Chorale.
    - Represents Patton's faith. Deeply religious; actively believed that God
      was with the Americans.
  - Theme: Reincarnation.
    - Patton believed deeply that he reincarnated repeatedly as a great
      warrior.
    - It's just two notes from a trumpet (military association).
    - ... but electronically echo'd.
  - Watched: North Africa
    - [Sound cloud] of strings and woodwinds
    - Uses the reincarnation theme.
  - Watched: Advance in Europe
    - Montage. Blends all three themes.
    - March theme when Patton is with his men.
    - Religious theme with the commanding officers. "Patton is a gift."
    - Reincarnation theme when we see the list of German casualties.
  - Showed Jerry Goldsmith's versatility.

- Another film: Tora Tora Tora. Similar to Patton, but for the Japanese.

- Saving Private Ryan: The soundtrack is really quiet. Many scenes have no
  music. This is deliberate.

- Other things Jerry Goldsmith wrote
  - The Universal fanfare. Watched Minions Universal Fanfare.
  - Star Trek, Star Trek Voyager

- Film: [Planet of the Apes] ([1968])
  - Composer: [Jerry Goldsmith]
  - First rule: Don't watch it and take it literally.
  - Social and political critique. Critiques racism.
    - Orangutans: Intellectuals. Chimpanzees: Bureaucracy. Gorillas: Heavies.
    - Minister of Science = Chief Defender of the Faith. "There is no conflict
      between faith and TRUE science."

- Planet of the Apes: Scene 1: The Takers
  - Absolutely no tonal melodies, but the music does have structure.
  - Music for astronauts: Clear, even rhythm supported by snare drum.
  - Music for unseen takers: Chaotic. Chirping woodwinds, log drums. More
    primitive sound.
  - Many strange instruments. Metal mixing bowls, ram's horn, prepared piano

- Planet of the Apes: Scene 2: The Crossing (Part 1)
  - No clear organization. More sound than music.
  - Uses electronic echo, metal sheet, ram's horn
  - Sounds hopeless.

- Planet of the Apes: Scene 3: The Crossing (Part 2): Plant
  - Where there's one, there's another, and another...
  - Theme composed of:
    - Four sets of 3 notes.
    - Another four sets of 3 notes.
    - Then repeat from first set.
    - This is the 12 tone technique.
      - 2 11 12 5 4 1 3 10 8 9 6 7
      - Then, inverted.

- 12 tone technique
  - From 1920s
  - By Arnold Schoenberg, of the second Viennese school
    - (First Viennese school: Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven)
  - All 12 notes equally important
  - First: Enumerate notes. C=1, ..., B=12
  - Create melody using note numbers.
  - Rule: Can't revisit a note until all 12 have been played.
  - How to create variations?
    - Retrograde (reverse)
    - Invert (negate diffs)

- Planet of the Apes: Scene 4: Opening Credits
  - Uses the same 12-tone tone row.

- Watched: re-capture
  - "Take your damn hands off me, ape"
  - Contains the one really solid tonal note.
  - Why? This is the only moment in the whole film where Taylor has the upper
    hand.

- Planet of the Apes: Scene 5: The Apes Appear
  - "We'll be running this planet" line doesn't age well.
  - Strong rhythm adds urgency to the scene
  - More intense as the apes are gradually revealed
  - Music peaks with the ram's horn. Accompanies the first clear view of the
    apes. Like the distortion of a hunting horn.

- Aside: Someone put the very last scene on the film box.

- Planet of the Apes: Final Scene
  - 12 tone theme and inversion play a lot
  - Echo on harp
  - No credits music = instant SUPERBLEAK
  - Ending music often brings you back into reality and gives you relief --
    doesn't happen here.

- Into the 1970s
  - Recap: Since the end of the 1940s, we see a move away from Steiner and
    Korngold.
    - More American composers
    - More pop music and modernism
  - Conglomeration continues.
  - Film costs increase. By 178% from 1972-77; by 200% from 1977-79.
  - 160 films per year. (Compare to 538 films in 1937.)
  - Many genre films/formula films. Many sequels.
  - Many pop scores: The Graduate (1967), Easy Rider (1969), The Last Picture
    Show (1971), American Graffiti (1973)
    - Simon thinks The Graduate and American Graffiti are particularly good
      uses of pop music as actual score.
  - Orchestras are seen as irrelevant.
  - Pop scores are much cheaper and aid in promotion.

- John Williams
  - Born 1932 to musical parents
  - Trained as a concert pianist at [Julliard]
  - Studied film music at UCLA
  - Was an orchestrator for Dimitri Tiomkin
  - Late 1950s: Worked in TV
    - Lost in Space (knockoff of Star Trek)
    - Land of the Giants
    - Gilligan's Island
  - Late 1960s: Starts to work in film
    - Got caught up in genre films. Absurdist sexy comedies, e.g. Not With My
      Wife You Don't. Also disaster films, e.g. The Towering Inferno,
      Earthquake (the first Sensaround (??) film)

- Film: [The Poseidon Adventure]
  - Composer: [John Williams]

- Film: [The Sugarland Express] (1974)
  - w/ Golden Hawn
  - Composer: [John Williams]
  - Director: [Steven Spielberg]
    - The two got along despite the age gap.
  - Big success.

- Film: [Jaws] (1975)
  - Unusual for many reasons.
    - To be released in the summer. Summer thought to be dead; fall more
      preferred. Jaws was the first "summer blockbuster".
    - New way to release films. Previously, films trickled out -- first in a
      big city theatres, then successively smaller cities. Jaws was done in a
      [Wide Release] -- released on 400 screens simultaneously.
    - Made back its money in 13 days.
      - Now, if a film fails to break even in 72 hours, it is considered a
        failure.
  - Helped re-establish orchestra in film score and pushed away from modernism.

- Simon grew up in Newmarket!!

- Steven Spielberg friends with George Lucas
  - Film: Close Encounters of the Third Kind
  - Meanwhile, George Lucas was working on Star Wars
  - George Lucas: "I want something that sounds like Korngold"
  - Spielberg: "Talk to my friend John Williams!"

- Film: [Star Wars] (1977)
  - Brought back Erich Korngold. Long melodies, hella tonal, thematic
    transformation.
  - Brings back the french horn (associated with outdoors, huntsman)

- The Rite of Spring
  - Early atonal ballet music by [Igor Stravinsky]
  - So radical that fist fights broke out in the audience

- Listened to: Jawa Sandcrawler theme
  - Very similar to The Rite of Spring

- Jaws theme
  - Very similar to a piece of The Rite of Spring
  - Alternating semitones represents shark's size
  - Consistent rhythm represents shark being a relentless force of nature

- Jaws: Scene 1: Shark Bounty
  - Sunday roast scene
  - You never see the shark, but the music and visuals let you know exactly
    what the shark is doing. (Varied music intensity)
  - Remarkably consistent association: The music is the shark... when you don't
    see it.

- Spielberg disappeared from set during the last set
  - Afraid that production crew would beat him up
  - Tradition: Spielberg always leaves for the last scene.

<!-- 2019-03-28 -->

# Week 11

- Simon's study tips:
  - Study a bit every day.
  - Pomodoro. 50 minutes study, 10 minute break.
  - Put your phone in another room.
  - Write by hand.

- Ridley Scott's Alien: Used the same imply-don't-show technique as Jaws.

- Jaws: Scene 2: Shark Attack
  - Spielberg regrets having a little boy shark victim.
    - "Both of those decisions were made by directors who had no idea what it's
      like to have children."
  - Reaction shot:
    - Exploits camera perspective
    - Modernist lick

- Jaws: Scene 3: The Prank
  - Legs, panic, screaming...
  - But shark music is missing. Only the beach band.
    - Diegetic nature of beach band reinforced when camera enters/leaves water
  - Lack of music establishes shark = dundun pattern.

- Fun fact: the Orca whale is the only natural shark predator. ... Quint's
  boat's name.

- Jaws: Scene 4: On the boat
  - "You're gonna need a bigger boat"
  - As Hooper and Quint organize, Williams uses [fugue].
    - Main melody is repeated and self-overlaps with variations.
  - Melody is quite elaborate this point.
  - Music builds up to moment Quint fires the gun
  - Music changes from dissonant to triumphant when the barrel hits the water.
    - Like Korngold pirate music.

- [Star Wars] ([1977])
  - Composer: John Williams
  - Made Williams the best-known film composer of all time.

- John Williams (cont.)
  - His style was:
    - 19th century orchestral.
    - Yet, aware of modernism and atonality.
    - Little pop or jazz influence. No pop songs.
    - Starts with a basic orchestra and adds what is necessary.
    - Uses and transforms complex themes throughout the film.
  - 1980-1993: Conductor of the Boston Pops Orchestra.
    - Reworks his film work into self-contained orchestral works
    - And so his music brought the world revolution.

- [James Horner]
  - 1953-2015
  - Born in USA
  - Raised in England
  - Attended [Royal College of Music]
  - Pretty pretentious. Felt that film composing was not a serious artistic
    outlet.
    - Wanted to teach theory. Taught theory at UCLA. Super modern.
  - 1978: Began composing for a film for the [American Film Institute].
    - Horner was blown away, seeing his music in a film. Revolutionized his
      world.
    - Decided to become a film composer.

- Film: [The Lady In Red] ([1979])
  - Composer: [James Horner]
  - Was a gangster movie.

- Film: [Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan] ([1982])
  - Composer: [James Horner]
  - James Horner's big breakthrough.

- Other James Horner films scored
  - Aliens (1986), Field of Dreams (1989), Braveheart (1995), Apollo 13 (1996)

- Film: [Titantic] ([1997])
  - Composer: [James Horner]
  - Won 1.5 academy awards (best original score; best original song "My Heart
    Will Go On", shared)
  - Big hit for Horner

- James Horner (cont.)
  - Style:
    - Strong, simple melodies. Conventional orchestra.
    - Also capable of incorporating electronic and avant-garde sounds.
    - Synchronizing music to scene and camera changes. (not Mickey Mousing)
      - Hits the cut
      - Alternatives:
        - Ahead of the cut (music changes before cut happens)
        - Behind the cut (music changes after cut happens)
    - No background in pop, but good at writing in pop styles

- Film: [Glory] ([1989])
  - Composer: [James Horner]
  - About Robert Shaw, naive war captain.
  - Watched: Beginning of film
    - Lots of reverb
    - Hits cuts very well
    - Did lots of time signature math to hit the cuts perfectly
    - Main theme carried by [boys choir]
      - Symbolizes Shaw's naivety
    - Score disappears in the real battle. Optimism evaporates.

- Star Trek
  - Made by Gene Roddenberry
  - Was syndicated and got really popular during this time.
    - Syndication: When they replay a show, cutting out some scenes to shove more
      ads in.
  - For a period, Star Trek was playing somewhere on the world 24/7.
  - Star Trek was super woke ahead of its time. Sure, white male captain; but
    Japanese crew member, Russian navigator (in the middle of the cold war),
    communications officer (black woman).
  - MLK story. "There's someone who looks like you doing something important."

- Film: [Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan] ([1982])
  - Composer: [James Horner]
  - Modern fan culture, fandoms, conventions -- all started with Star Trek.
  - First movie was not great.
  - This was great. Like a 2-hour TV episode.
  - Khan Noonien Singh: Popular villain.
  - "Let's bring back Khan... 15 years later both in- and out- universe."
    - Now Khan is fuming
    - And Kirk is an admiral.
  - Kirk receives a birthday present, uncharacteristically.
  - Kirk's room decorated with antiques.
  - Major film theme: Coming to terms with aging.
  - Watched: Khan Introduction
    - Modern and atonal.
    - Uses a dense sound cloud.
    - Theme is based on semitones.
  - Watched: Kirk and the Enterprise
    - Lovely, mellow, tonal theme for Kirk and the Enterprise.
    - Reaching for heroic note, but doesn't get there.
    - When heroic note is reached, key change has happened, lowering impact.
    - Conclusion: Kirk isn't a big action hero anymore.
  - Watched: Khan Attacks
    - Kirk's theme toggles with Khan's theme
    - Eventually, Kirk's theme is overpowered
    - When Khan attacks, Kirk's theme disappears.
    - Like 1800s British naval uniforms.
  - Watched: Surrender
    - Music tells us that Kirk is dinking.
    - Basically music conveys the tides of battle.

- Next week: Electronics, Elfman, Zimmer.

- Hans Zimmer (cont.)
  - Recent works are spacious/powerful -- electronic and orchestral.
    - Emphasizes timbre and rhythm, not melody.
  - Notably collaborated with Christopher Nolan.
  - Minimalist.
    - Simple idea. Very repetitive... but with complex layers.
    - Slowly builds over time.
  - Often composes during or before film is in production.
  - w/ Zimmer/Nolan, music and film are edited simultaneously.
  - Cues sometimes assembled from multiple pieces of music.
  - Owns production company Remote Control Productions.

- Film: [Interstellar] ([2014])
  - Watched: Final scene
    - Simon played the basic idea.
      - MOTHERUFCKER IT'S CELESTE
  - Nolan: "Can I book you for a day?"
    - Zimmer composed basic theme based on a single-page plot summary.
    - Nolan takes Zimmer's ideas into account.

- Film: [Inception] ([2010])
  - Simon played the basic idea.
  - Eight sets of two simultaneous notes.
  - > that's it. that's 80% of the music for inception.
  - A very strong melodic idea -- refined to hell and back with rhythm and
    timbre.
  - The Macguffin: Device allows you to infiltrate dreams.
  - Watched: End scene.
  - Watched: The kick.
    - Many different cues faded between each other.

- Star Wars is NOT science fiction. It's fantasy. Only the setting is
  sci-fi-like.
  - True science fiction is reality + adjustment. Makes us dink

- Hans Zimmer (cont.)
  - Has been TOO influential !!
  - Braaaaaaaaaammmmmm: Bunch of brass plays lowest note possible.
  - Literally every trailer has BRAAAAAAAAM
  - Many many composers now need to Zimmer-emulate
    - Watched: Mad Maxy: Fury Road OST (12 BROTHERS IN ARMS)
  - Watched: Star Trek 2009 Trailer HD 1080p
    - It's great music, but that music... is not in the film.
      - Since trailers come out so early, film may not even have music.
    - Music created by Two Steps from Hell.
      - They're basically creators of HUGE-sounding music.
      - Almost 1k film credits.
      - Strategy: Sound like Hans Zimmer.
  - Has said that he doesn't want to do superhero movies anymore.
  - Also did:
    - Dunkirk. Very unpleasant, tense, harsh music.
    - Blade Runner sequel.

- So we conclude.
- The class applauded for a very long time at this point.
- Eventually Simon began to conduct the clapping volume down... and up.
