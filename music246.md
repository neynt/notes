# MUSIC 246: Soundtracks

Professor: Simon Wood

<!-- 2019-01-10 -->

## Week 1: What to Listen for in Film

- Required textbook: Reel Music 2nd - Hickman
  - On reserve at Conrad Grebel
- I write music for a living, also a bass player
- Grading is 25% test 1, 30% test 2, 45% final
- All tests are multiple choice
- Homework: Watch a movie every week
- (While talking about academic integrity) You're Waterloo students for god's
  sake. If anyone can cheat, it's you guys.
- Hans Zimmer ruined everything for everybody

- Visceral enjoyment of film depends on suspension of disbelief.
- You like music because patterns. Patterns provide meaning.

- Film: [Apollo 13] ([1995])
- Composer: [James Horner]
  - (Also did Titanic and Avatar)
- Has the Ready Room scene

- Simon was 10 when Apollo 13 happened

- [The Ready Room] scene:
  - Watched twice. First time without sound.
  - Marilyn Lovell lost wedding ring in shower drain; cut immediately to
    astronauts getting ready
  - Directors like showers (not just because of the nudititity)
  - Pay attention also to where music isn't. Figure and ground
  - No music in shower scene:
    - Reflects intimacy of shower.
    - Allows other sounds to cut through -- shower noise and whimpers add
      discomfort
    - Leaves space for ready room scene and launch scene.
  - SHOWERS are SKETCHY PLACES, AREN'T THEY?
  - Music starts shortly before cut from shower to ready room. Made cut less
    jarring.
    - They "anticipated" the cut. Alternatively, sometimes you "hit" the cut,
      or "delay" the cut.
  - Instruments: Brass.
    - Embodies military, heroism, sacrifice.
  - Style: [Chorale].
    - Embodies faith, sacrifice.
    - [Chorale]: A Protestant hymn. Simple melody written for Protestant
      congregation to sing.
    - Astronauts stretch in the shape of a crucifix.
  - Tempo: Slow.
    - Restrained, controlled, professional.
  - Texture changes with the next cut.

- Mrs. Doubtfire recut as a horror movie

- Movies tell stories, and that depends on suspension of disbelief
- Flimmakers minimize anything that goes against suspension of disbelief...
  except music!

- The four general functions of music:
  - 1. [To convey time and place.]
    - Based on (western) history, culture, geography
    - 1930s and 40s films were kinda racist; captured perception, not reality,
      of other cultures
  - 2. [To refine psychology.]
    - Character's inner thoughts. Foreshadowing.
  - 3. [To provide a sense of continuity.]
    - Smooths over cuts.
    - Montages oft employ pop songs.
  - 4. [To provide buildup.]
    - "provides the underpinning for the theatrical buildup of a scene, then
      round it off with a sense of finality"
    - pacing

- Film: [Raiders of the Lost Ark] ([1981])
- Composer: [John Williams]
- This film is a homage to 1940s adventure serials
  - Homage is a French word meaning "homage"
- Three parts: classic theme, love theme, egypt
- Functions [1, 3, 4.
  - F1: Scale change and oboe: Arrival in Egypt.
    - Oboe is closest Western instrument to Egypt/India (but still far)
  - F3: Although location changes quickly from Tibet to Egypt, music stays
    continuous
  - F4: Action makes way for quiet dialogue. Brings action to a close.]

- Film: [Alien Resurrection] ([1997])
- Composer: [John Frizzell]
- "Alien" is one of the best horror films. "Aliens" is one of the best war
  films. This is a big oops
- Functions [2, 4.
  - F2: Music "catches" Call's reaction to hearing Ripley's name. Foreshadows
    the connection between them.
  - F4: Slow dialogue changes to chaotic action, then slows to conclude.]
- Actors weren't expecting Ripley to hit the shot. Watch the uncut footage, is
  funny.

- Closing notes:
  - Read LEARN
  - Get films. Don't get remakes. Get originals.
  - Start paying attention to music.

## Week 2

- Shirt: Reunite Pangea
- Let's learn some terms!

- [Diegesis]: [The world of the narrative].

- [Diegetic music]: [Music that actually happens in the story].
  - aka: Source music, direct music, foreground music
  - Functions 1, creates sense of "realism and immediacy", offers ironic
    comment

- Nondiegetic is not diegetic.
  - aka: Score, underscore, background music
  - Can be composed for the film, or
  - Can be preexisting music adapted to the film

- Film: [The Sting] ([1973])
  - Original composer: [Scott Joplin]
  - Pre-existing music style: Ragtime
  - Listened to: The Entertainer
  - Adapted (very subtly) by: [Marvin Hamlisch]
  - Setting is the Depression, but ragtime comes from 30 years earlier

- Film: [Platoon] ([1986])
  - Composer: [Georges Deleure]
  - Listened to: [Adagio for Strings]
  - Also includes Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings (1938)
    - This was also used in:
      - The Elephant Man (1980)
      - Sicko (2007)
  - "Why'd you send my score back in a week?!"
    - "I didn't need it. I've memorized it."

- Compiled score: Score made entirely out of preexisting music

- Film: [2001: A Space Odyssey] ([1968])
  - Directed by: [Stanley Kubrick]
    - Dude loved compiled scores
    - Molded movie around music he was listening to
  - Compiled score
  - Compiled from: R. Strauss, J. Strauss...
  - Listened to: Ligeti - 2001 - Atmospheres
    - Simon loved this when he was 7

- Style
  - Category of music
  - Instruments used
  - Relation to film

- Film: [Local Hero] ([1983])
  - Composer: [Mark Knopfler]
  - About an American sent to a small Scottish village... to buy the town (oil)
  - Blends folk and pop styles
  - Emphasized guitar
  - Melodies similar to Anglo-Celtic folk music

- Film: [The Godfather] ([1972])
  - Composer: [Nino Rota]
  - Listened to: The Godfather Waltz
    - First statement: Sad trumpet
    - Then, enters: Waltz. It's a dance. Clarinet, some mandolin-family
      instrument. Sicilian wedding band.

- Conceptual approaches
  - Film music falls on a continuum from:
    - Playing the drama. Music reinforces emotions in the narrative.
    - Phrasing the drama. Music is appropriate for the scene, but can catch
      specific moments of action or emotion.
    - Hitting the action. Music accents visual events.
      - Common in cartoons, but should avoid "mickey mousing" (when it's too
        obvious).

- Musical characteristics
  - Melody/theme
    - The "main" line
    - [Leitmotif]
      - Melody associated with narrative thing
      - Instantiated in unique ways
      - [Richard Wagner]
    - Simon's rule: Hummability is positivity

- Simon Wood can't watch GoT; constant sexytime/beheadings. "I get embarrassed"
- Simon was once told "You know, your music is really much better than it
  sounds"

- Film: [Star Wars] ([1977])
  - Composer: [John Williams]
  - Simon saw this film 14 times
  - Don't remind Simon that prequels exist or there will be "difficulties with
    your grade"
  - Listened to: Luke Skywalker theme

- Musical characteristics (cont.)
  - Tempo
    - How fast the music is
    - Can influence perceived speed of film

- Film: [The Return of the King] ([2004])
  - Composer: [Howard Shore]
  - (Watched this)
  - Story is walking to fights, then walking because of bad ring.
  - Hobbit song begins as source music, but then becomes score over a
    discordant suicide charge.
  - Music stops when evil fires arrows.

- Musical characteristics (cont.)
  - Harmony
    - major happy minor sad
    - Consonance is orderly, familiar. Dissonance is weird.
    - Listened to: Main Title - Cider House Rules ([1999])
      - Composer: [Rachael Portman]
      - Highly consonant
      - Women do most of music, but as contractors and musicians... but not
        composers
        - [Sandy DeCrescent]: Prolific female music contractor
    - Listened to: Yes - Meet Joe Black ([1998]) (Composer: [Thomas Newman])
      - Consonant and dissonant
    - Listened to: Bishop's Countdown - Aliens ([1986])
      - Composer: [James Horner]
      - Quite dissonant
      - Becomes tonal for a moment of hope; then disintegrates
      - Segment was most used music in movie trailers for years

- Technical details
  - Three phases of filmmaking
    - 1. Preproduction
      - This is preparation. Script, financing, casting, costume/set design,
        location scouting
    - 2. Production
      - Script and production design is finalized
      - Principle photography
      - Cut -> next scene
      - Cut and that's a wrap -> we're done!
    - 3. Postproduction
      - Editing and assembling the **takes**
      - Visual and audio effects
        - Practical effects often preferable/pure but hard
        - Foley artists are cool
      - Music
        - Original film score is often one of the last things to be made.
        - Composition and recording a score usually takes [5-8] weeks
  - Composer's involvement
    - Hiring
      - Studio contract
      - Freelance
      - Collaborative partnerships, e.g. Spielberg/Williams, Nolan/Zimmer
  - Scripts
    - Give composers a head start
    - Allows research into ethnic, historical influences
      - The Last Samurai (2003) (Composer: [Hans Zimmer])
    - Script alone is generally not enough to compose
      - Script can change a lot
      - No timing or pace information

- [Screenings]
  - These are different opportunities to see the film.
  - [Rushes]: [Film shot in a single day]
  - [Assembly cut]: [Much longer than finished film]
    - e.g. Titanic's assembly cut was 12 hours long
  - [Rough cut]: Closer to finished film
  - [Fine cut/Locked cut]: Most editing completed
  - Most composers begin serious work with the locked cut
    - Not only does this give them timing information, but...
    - Limiting familiarity with film is beneficial

<!-- 2019-01-24 -->

## Week 3

- A [temp track] is [temporary film music for early editing].
  - Often stolen from other films, or classical music.
  - Composers like temp tracks because they provide insight into the director's
    wishes, BUT they can cause the director to become overfamiliar

- The [spotting session] is the first time the director, composer, and music
  editor sit and discuss the placement of [cue]s (timing, approach).
- A [cue] is a single piece for the purpose of the film.
- The music editor provides spotting notes/cue sheet.
  - Looks like a table with the columns:
    - cue#: xMy
      - Numbering is historical; x is the reel number, y is cue index
    - start and stop times, in format Hr:Min:Sec:Frame
    - duration
    - notes

- Composing is rough
  - they have [1-2] months to deliver the finished scores
  - release date is fixed; get it done or you'll never work again
  - production phase oft runs overtime; they don't care
  - e.g. in Aliens, some music is duplicated/reused

- [Orchestrators]
  - People skilled in composition, music theory, orchestra knowledge
  - Like the line cooks, or tweeners, of music
  - John Williams' orchestrator: Herbert Spencer
    - Composers yellow sheet music; orchestrators green
    - "My job was copying yellow over to green"
    - Other times... "2m31s waltz"

- [Synth demonstration]
  - Score played with digital instruments for the composer just to make sure
    it's good

- Other roles
  - A [copyist] produces individual sheets of music from the orchestrator's
    score
  - A [music librarian] organizes the parts for recording sessions
  - Conductors and studio musicians (who are good sight readers) are also
    needed
    - Star Wars theme final recording was 5th time; they got rid of preamble at
      the beginning

- Synchronization can be done with click tracks (everyone wears headphones), or
  punches and streamers
    - [Punch]: burst of bright light from the screen seen through peripheral
      vision
      - Used to be done by punching holes in frames
    - [Streamers]: vertical lines that sweep the screen in 2 seconds
      - Used to be done with a yardstick on the film

- Mixing: All music is added up.
- Watched: an extra from Wall-E
- This concludes concepts. Will start history now.

- Screening questions:
- Adventures of Robinhood not on first test.

- Western Classical ("Concert Hall") Music in 12 Minutes
  - Pre-baroque: Weird middle ages stuff
  - [Baroque]: [1600-1750]
    - Composers: Vivaldi, Handel, Bach
    - [Common Practice]: [12 semitone system with major/minor scales]
    - Mathematical
    - Even tempos; consistent (instrument) textures; terraced (discrete step)
      dynamics
    - Listened to: Brandenburg Concerto No. 6, 3rd movement (1721) (Composer:
      [Bach])
  - [Classical]: [1730-1820]
    - Composers: Mozart, Hayden, Beethoven
    - Greater focus on melody and emotion
      - Big chunky chords with complex melody on top

  - [Romantic]: [1800-1910]
    - Composers: Wagner (!!), Tchaikovsky, Strauss
    - Super feelsy
    - Ended with World War I
    - Listened to: The Magic Fire Music - Die Walkure (1870) (Composer:
      [Wagner])
      - This sounds a lot like film music... because film composers yanked a
        ton from Wagner

- 1800s
  - Much music by Wagner
  - Melodramas (see textbook)

- [The Silent Era]
  - [1895-1927]
  - [The persistence of vision]: The point where you stop seeing separate
    images and start to see continuous motion. About 14 FPS.

- The [Zoopraxiscope] ([1879]) projected moving images on a disk

- [Thomas Edison]
  - A big jerk
  - (Also stole the gramophone)
  - [1891]: Made the [Kinetoscope], a peephole viewer with a continuous loop of
    film
    - the first animated gifs OMG
    - NOT the invention of motion pictures because they were individual
      experiences
  - [1895]: Made the [Kinetophone], a Kinetoscope + Phonograph
  - Problem with synchronization: ???

- [The Lumiere Brothers]
  - Made the first projected film in Paris, [1895 Dec 28]
  - Considered the birth of cinema.
  - Watched: The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat
  - Had live piano accompaniment. Reasons:
    - 1. [Pragmatic. To hide mechanical noise.]
    - 2. [Psychoanalytic. Makes the ghost-like images less disturbing.]
    - 3. [Continuity of tradition: Visual presentations have ALWAYS had music!]
  - Musical accompaniment consisted of:
    - Adaptations of classical music (most popular)
    - Arrangements of popular songs
    - Originally composed music
  - Venues included:
    - Vaudeville theatres, where these were called "[photoplays]" and the
      vaudeville orchestra provided music

- [1905]: [Nickelodeons] were theatres where you could watch films for a
  nickel.
  - You could stay as long as you wanted.
  - Music provided by piano, player piano, ensemble, or gramophone; music still
    not synchronized with film.
  - Grew quickly
    - 1907: 3,000 of them
    - 1910: over 10,000

- [1905-1910]: [Narrative films become a thing.]
  - Music starts to "play the picture"; "fit" and "synchronize".
  - Not original scores yet. Just musicians looking at the film and playing
    appropriate music.

  - By [George Méliès]
  - Over 10 minutes in length, with multiple scenes
  - Was in color, with each frame painted

- Film: The Great Train Robbery ([1903])

  - Films become longer, deeper.
  - [1912]: The first movie palace is built.
  - Introduction of [theatre organs] with sound effects.
  - [Hollywood]
    - Refused to enforce Thomas Edison's patents.
    - Thus, everyone who wanted to make films went there.

- [1909]: [Edison Film Company] releases "musical suggestions" with each film.

- [1912]: [Max Winkler] of [Carl Fischer Music] suggests specific pieces of
  music with timings.
  - Films shipped with [cue sheets], which might include music
  - One of the first "music fitters".
  - Other thing: [Resource book]

- [Motion Picture World]
  - An industry magazine for filmmaking
  - Had articles and columns about music accompaniment, and made some general
    rules:
    - Music should be continuous
    - Source music is important
    - "Song title" references -- where the only relevant thing is the song
      title -- is bad taste
    - Use of themes
    - Big debate about using "good" (classical) music.
      - Films can expose the common man to great art!

- Mid 19[20]s
  - Filmmakers realized that live performance won't work because:
    - Much variance in performing talent
    - Photo-play musicians felt self-sure
    - Missing cue sheets and scores

- Film: [Birth of a Nation] ([1915])
  - Director: [DW Griffith]
    - Super racist
  - Composer: [Joseph Carl Breil]
  - Initial music fitter: [Carli Elinor]
  - The South are the heroes. The heroes are the KKK.
  - Watched a scene twice.
    - Southern town. War declared; great celebration.
    - Parade, then family goes back in house.
    - First version
      - Small town version.
      - Small competent group of musicians.
      - Parade is exuberant; house is sombre. "Oh no, they're gone now."
    - Second version
      - Big city version.
      - The negative is reversed?
      - Folk song (When Johnny Comes Marching Home) continues into the home.

- Next week: Get rid of the live musicians.

- TEST 1 ENDS HERE

<!-- 2019-01-31 -->

## Week 4

- WHAT WAS THE OPENING MUSIC
  - It was John Powell's soundtrack for How To Train Your Dragon
- Simon is redoing basement -- bad time to have no insulation

- 1922: Earliest demos of sound films with two competing systems.
  - 1. [Sound On Disk]
    - Phonograph synchronized with projector.
    - Good audio quality; bad synchronization.
    - e.g. [Warner Bros]'s [Vitaphone]
      - Huge records
      - Soft material, detailed grooves -- wore out fast (only 20 plays)
  - 2. [Sound On Film]
    - Came out after Sound On Disk
    - Bad audio quality; perfect synchronization.
    - e.g. Phonofilm, Movietone

- Film: [Don Juan] ([1926])
  - Used Vitaphone
    - Biggest thing on the billboard is VITAPHONE!
    - Stored soundtrack, sound effects. No dialog.
  - Recorded score, composed by [William Axt], performed by NY Philharmonic

    - First film with full synchronized dialogue, but there's only a bit of it
  - Star: [Al Jolson] (think Lady Gaga)
  - Had some compiled score from [Tchaikovsky (Romeo and Juliet)]
  - Silent staring accommodates record switching machine
  - Awful dialogue. Who got paid for writing it? No one! Scriptwriters weren't
    a thing yet. Dialogue was improvised.
    - All these things we take for granted / These things are just about to be
      invented
  - Most people still didn't see the film with Vitaphone
  - Massive financial success

- Early 19[30]s: Sound on Film's audio quality improved and it took over
  - Sound films were much more expensive to make
  - Silent films often didn't care about extraneous sounds, such as cueing the
    actors

- [The Studio System]
  - Departmentalized production style used during [1930s-50s]
  - Movie studios buy each other up:
    - The Big Five: [MGM], [Paramount], [Warner Bros], [20th Century Fox]

    - was not possible for a while due to technology limitations
  - All sound had to be recorded in real time
    - Cameras put in large soundproof booths, which prevents movement
    - Musicians had to be on set

- Studio System - Showing films
  - Too many contesting sound systems
  - [1929]: 1000/20000 theatres equipped for sound

    connections lol
  - If you do a good job, word gets around about you

- Test 1
  - 55 minutes
  - Multiple choice
  - Not in here; tests in here are more like group research projects

  - Everything's up. Films, dates, names all included.

- Film: [Cimarron] ([1931])
  - Composed by [Max Steiner]
