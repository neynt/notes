* 09:58: "It's supposed to be the Haibane's obligation to use things that people no longer need."
* 10:59: "It's a rule that the Haibane can only wear used clothes."
* 11:16: "hanebukuro" -- They really put a lot of thought into the little details involved in actually having wings.
* 12:46: Rakka's clothes are the only slightly-colorful ones
* 13:55: what a nice guy!

* 16:38: crow scene
* 17:37: "What's beyond the walls?" "Nobody knows." SHINGEKI
* 21:47: so emotional strain can cause haibane to go weak. and the halo is sticking to Rakka now!

## Episode 4

* 00:33: This is a pretty sublime soundtrack.

* 14:13: Saltblock would like this apron action
* 14:44: "It's kind of like being treated like children." (on the town being protective of Haibane)
* 18:35: "We're not supposed to meddle too much in the Haibane's lives."
* 19:51: He's such a big bloop

## Episode 5

* 01:16: "the beginning of the world"
* 01:26: "I wonder if those are the years of the books."
* 03:21: I also don't really remember what it was like when I was born.
* 03:48: Clever
* 04:00: Sumika is moto-senpai

* 09:26: "sekai no hajimari" book
* 09:36: came up with the rest of the story
* 13:00: everyone is supporting each other in unseen ways. I wonder if I deserve to be happy as I am. tru feel 
* 23:00: one hell of a creation story. I feel like the haibane represent something very relevant.

## Episode 6

* 02:36: daww winter coat gift
* 15:28: that column of light was definitely kuu
* 17:19: nishi no mori. not just the birds though. a light.
* 18:01: Day of Flight (sudachi no hi): haibane's leaving-day.
* 20:57: it's his halo
* 21:20: with feathers.motherfuck
* 21:49: memorial
* 22:47: "In the end, everyone leaves me." whoa where did that come from

The Day of Flight represents... death, maybe? A coming-of-age, maybe? Either way, you're leaving behind people who cherish you.
