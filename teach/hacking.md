## how 2 leet haxor

- basically hacking is about:
  - understanding how a system works
  - using that understanding to make it behave in a way that you want (but was
    maybe not intended)

- arms race between developers and hackers

- places to gain skills
  - write code
  - overthewire: fun, very beginner friendly, teaches foundational knowledge
  - wechall
  - tryhackme: more beginner friendly with tutorials
  - hackthebox: more realistic boxes to try and pop
  - CTFs

- don't just look up solutions
- ... but, know when to give up

- strike a balance between using existing tools and creating your own
