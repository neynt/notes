# Week 1

- Two modes of thinking:
  - Focused. Concentrated on task at hand with well-travelled neural path.
  - Diffuse. Broad, making large leaps, but unfocused.
  - These modes are pretty mutually exclusive
  - Tricks to access the diffuse mode:
    - Salvador Dali gathered diffuse ideas by holding a key in his hand while
      falling asleep. The moment he fell asleep, the key would fall and clank
      and wake him up.
    - Thomas Edison would hold ball bearings to do a similar thing.
  - Go back and forth between the two learning modes
- Avoid procrastination by using the Pomodoro technique
- Two types of memory:
  - Working: like a low resolution blackboard
  - Long term: like a warehouse
  - Use spaced repetition to promote things into your long term memory
- Sleep washes away toxins in your brain
- Exercise is a decent substitute for a stimulating environment
