# CS 349: User Interfaces

Professor: Jeff Avery

Things you need to know about CS 349:

## 1.2 Windowing systems
- X Client runs on the server. X Server is the lightweight client.
- Base Window System: Geometry
- Window Manager: Decorations, incl. Look and Feel
- Clipping
- Double buffering
- Painter's algorithm

## 2.2 Drawing
- Pixel, stroke, region.
- Graphics contexts save memory

## 2.2 Events
- Events. Event dispatch, selecting, handling, loops
- Interactor tree is the widget hierarchy

## 2.3 Event dispatch
- Positional dispatch: input to widget under cursor
  - Bottom-up: leaf, then possibly parent
  - Top-down: parent, then possibly leaf
- Focus dispatch: input to "focused" widget

## 3.2 Affine transformations
- 2D coordinate represented as 3-vector as [x y 1]
- Translation is \[\[1 0 tx] \[0 1 ty] \[0 0 1]]
- Rotation is \[\[cos(th) -sin(th) 0] \[sin(th) cos(th) 0] \[0 0 1]]
- Scaling is \[\[sx 0 1] \[0 sy 1] \[0 0 1]]

## 4.3 Layout
- Layout manager: does the algorithm
- Composite: things are made of other things
- Strategy: substitutable algorithm
- Layout strategies:
  - Fixed layout (null)
  - Intrinsic size: sized based on contained widgets
  - Variable intrinsic size: 
  - Struts and springs

## 5.1 Design Principles
- Gulf of Execution, Gulf of Evaluation
- Design principles:
  - Affordances
  - Mapping
  - Constraints
  - Visibility/Feedback
  - Metaphor

## 5.2 Design Process
- User-Centred Design:
  - 1. Understand user's needs
  - 2. Design the UI first
  - 3. Iterate
  - 4. Use it yourself
  - 5. Observe others using it
- High vs. low-fidelity prototypes
- Paper prototyping
- Wizard of Oz prototypes
  - Use a human to simulate system response

## 6.1 Visual Design
- Gestalt Principles (grouping)
  - Proximity
  - Similarity
  - Good Continuation
  - Mnemonic: PSG ;)
- Gestalt Principles (ambiguity, missing data)
  - Figure/Ground
  - Uniform Connectedness
  - Closure
  - Alignment
  - Law of Pragnanz
  - Mnemonic: FUCAL
- Pleasing Layouts
  - Contrast
  - Repetition
  - Proximity
  - Alignment

## 6.2 Responsiveness
- Give users feedback about things that are happening.
- 0.001s for gap of silence. 0.01s for visual stimulus. 0.1s for saccade.
- 0.14s to cause-effect. 0.15s for word comprehension. 1s for motor reaction. 6-30s attention span.
- Tricks:
  - Busy indicator
  - Progress bar -- use imprecision
  - Display important information first (first page, first search results, progressive images)
  - Fake heavy computations like scaling
  - Work ahead
- In Java: use threads
- On Web: AJAX

## 7.1 Undo
- Must decide on actions, UI, granularity, scope
- Forward and reverse:
  - Forward undo: On undo, start from baseline and apply all change records
  - Reverse undo: On undo, apply last "reverse" change record
- Change records:
  - Memento: Snapshot of state, either complete or difference
  - Command: Commands to execute or unexecute
- Redo: put CRs popped from undo stack onto redo stack
- In Java: javax.swing.undo.\*, UndoManager, UndoableEdit

## 7.2 Copy/Paste, Drag/Drop
- Application tells clipboard available formats in order of preference
- Local clipboard is within program, system clipboard is system-wide
- In Java: java.awt.datatransfer, Clipboard, DataFlavor, Transferable, Toolkit
- Drag and Drop also uses ^

## 7.3 History
- Things weren't always this good
- Paradigms:
  - Batch
  - Conversational
  - Graphical
- Vannevar Bush
  - Manhattan project, "As We May Think", "memex"
- Ivan Sutherland
  - Sketchpad (~1963), light pen, direct manipulation, early GUI
- Douglas Engelbart
  - (~1968) Mouse, hypertext, copy/paste
  - Mother of All Demos for NLS
- Alan Kay
  - OOP (Smalltalk), Xerox Star, Dynabook, OLPC
  - "The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
- Today:
  - User in control
  - Recognition over recall
  - Metaphors

## 8.1 Android (not testable)
- Activity lifecycle:
  - Created
  - Started
  - Resumed
  - Paused (resume -> Resumed)
  - Stopped (restart -> Started)
  - Destroyed
- Intents pass data between activities.
- Fragments are portions of a UI.
- Views are widgets.
- Java: ViewGroup, View

## 8.2 Touch interfaces
- Look and feel:
  - Look: presentation of objects in the interface
  - Feel: Translation of user expression to state manipulation
- Domain object: things
- Interaction model: set of properties/rules that guide interface design
- Interaction instrument: tools to manipulate things
- Activation
  - Spatial: Moving cursor into area
  - Temporal: Entered a mode in the past
- Degrees
  - Degree of indirection: Spatial/temporal offset
    - e.g. dragging to resize: close
    - e.g. scrollbar, dialogs: far
  - Degree of integration: Ratio of DOF of input to DOF of instrument
    - e.g. 1 DOF scrollbar by 2 DOF mouse -> 0.5 ratio
    - e.g. 3 DOF 3D model by 2 DOF mouse -> 1.5 ratio
  - Degree of compatibility: Similarity of action
    - e.g. dragging a thing: high
    - e.g. scrolling: medium
    - e.g. dialog: low
- NUI: Natural user interface. Lots of direct manipulation.
- Technology
  - Resistive
    - Transparent conductive layers of microdots.
    - Locate via low resistance.
  - Capacitive
    - Emitters at 4 corners of screen.
    - Location determined by triangulating from the 4 corners.
  - Mutual capacitance 
    - Measure capacitance at points in a grid.
    - Allows for multitouch.
    - Driving lines have current. Sensing lines detect current at nodes.
  - Inductive
    - Magnetized stylus, like the Wacom in the Galaxy Note.
    - Accurate, but expensive.
  - Optical
    - Cameras watch the surface.
    - DSI: Diffused Surface Illumination
    - FTIR: Frustrated Total Internal Reflection
    - Overlays (light plane)
- Stylus vs. Touch
- Input states
  - Mouse has three input states (not touching, hover, dragging)
  - Touch only has 2 (not touching and touching)
  - Pen can have 2 (passive stylus) or 3 (active stylus)
- Challenges of touch input
  - 1. Fat finger problem: Finger occludes target.
  - 2. Ambiguous feedback: no tactile click.
  - 3. Third state missing: no hover.
  - 4. Multi-touch capture: 2 fingers 1 button. Over-capture.
  - 5. Physical constraints: attempts to move beyond range. Elastics help.
- Direct manipulation

## 9.1 Touchless interfaces
- Things we can sense
  - Position (global and local), motion, range, orientation, gaze, speech, EEG
- Signal to command system:
  - 1. Preprocessing (compress, smooth, threshold, downsample, handle latency)
  - 2. Feature selection (e.g. distance between eyes)
  - 3. Classification (recognize which gesture was performed)
- Challenges:
  - Computational cost
  - Traditional vs. non-traditional interfaces
  - Managing errors
- Challenge: Balancing usage patterns
  - Explicit interaction: user takes action, expects timely response
  - Implicit interaction: user's mood or long-term behavior
- Challenge: Errors
  - False positive: No intent, but system recognized gestures. Too sensitive.
  - False negative: Intent, but system does not recognize. Not sensitive enough.
- Clutch: Delimiter for starting/stopping gesture recognition
- Speech UI errors:
  - Rejection error: System has no hypothesis about what user said
  - Substitution error: Mistaken utterance
  - Insertion error: Recognize noise as utterance

  - Mouse [B]utton
  - [H]and move between mouse and keyboard
  - [M]ental preparation
  - Each symbol has a time. Write symbols, sum times.
- Fitts' Law
  - MT = a + b log2 (D/W + 1)
  - MT is the movement time
  - a, b are characteristics of the input device
  - D is distance between the starting point and center of the target
  - W is the constraining size of the target
  - Index of Performance: b (MT/ID approx = 1/b)
  - Index of Difficulty: log2 (D/W + 1)
  - W is technically the width along the direction of travel, but usually it's
    just the minimum of the width and height
- Steering Law
  - ID\_N = log2 (A/(NW) + 1)
  - Index of Difficulty T = lim N to infty of sum i=1 to N of b log\_2 (A/(NW) + 1)
                          = bA/W
  - b is input device characteristic
  - A is amplitude
  - W is width of path
  - N is number of goals

## 11.2 Accessibility
- Ability dimensions: age, gender, culture, language...
- Temporary disabilities:
  - Sickness, injury: impaired cognitive and motor
  - Driving a car: limited attentional bandwidth
- Tap on targets experiment (sitting, treadmill, and obstacle course)
  - Obstacle course was hardest, walking speeds didn't really matter
- Reading experiment (sitting vs. obstacle course)
  - Slower when walking, and much worse comprehension
- 10-20% have long-term disability
- OS accessibility support
- Accommodating disabled people is required by law in the US
- Curb cut phenomenon: accessible design beneficial for everyone
  - Cassette tapes: Compact and portable

- Cognetics: "ergonomics of the mind"
- Perception: visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile (5 senses)
- Short-term and long-term
  - Short-term memory: 0-several seconds
    - Attention: Selecting several of the available activations from perception
    - 7 +/- 2 items. Clustering helps.
    - Volatile.
    - Helped by:
      - Modes
      - Keeping search results on screen
      - Keeping instructions visible
  - Long-term memory: minutes, hours, ..., years
    - Error-prone. Lossily compressed. Emotionally weighted. Alterable.
- Recognition and recall
  - Recognition: Triggering an existing pattern by perception.
  - Recall: Triggering an existing pattern without perception.
- Cognitive unconscious: Huge resources, not really controllable
- Cognitive conscious: Tiny but powerful resources
- Locus: Thing you're consciously thinking about
  - Context switch takes about 10 seconds
- Change blindness: unnoticed visual change
- Automatic action: driving etc.
- Practice makes permanent

## 13.1 Ethics
