\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Scarcity
\series default
 is the source of all economic problems.
 
\series bold
Economics
\series default
 studies how to allocate limited resources to unlimited wants.
 
\series bold
Microeconomics
\series default
 focuses on the choices of individuals and businesses.
 
\series bold
Macroeconomics
\series default
 focuses on the performance of entire countries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Opportunity cost
\series default
 is what you forego when you make a decision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Economists have two roles: the scientist and the policy advisor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The economic problem

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
production possibilities frontier
\series default
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 shows the possible production of combinations of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 It is never concave down.
 The 
\series bold
opportunity cost
\series default
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $-\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Production efficiency
\series default
 means that we are on the PPF.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Allocative efficiency
\series default
 means in addition that we produce the goods that provide the greatest possible
 benefit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
marginal cost
\series default
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is the slope of the PPF.
 The 
\series bold
marginal benefit
\series default
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is the increase in utility from another 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, measured in 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\series bold
marginal benefit curve
\series default
 specifies marginal benefit and generally goes down (the 
\series bold
principle of decreasing marginal benefit
\series default
).
 At the point of allocative efficiency, the marginal cost and marginal benefit
 are equal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Economic growth
\series default
 expands the PPF and comes in the forms of 
\series bold
technology
\series default
 and 
\series bold
capital accumulation
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Trade
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Comparative advantage
\series default
 means you can produce something at a lower opportunity cost.
 
\series bold
Absolute advantage
\series default
 means you produce more of everything.
 If everyone specializes in things they have a comparative advantage in
 and trade, everyone ends up better off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Economic coordination
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The four social institutions that produce a decentralized economy:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Firms

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
circular flow diagram
\series default
 shows how:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Firms sell the goods/services that households buy, in return for their spending
 (the firm's revenue).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Households provide the factors of production that firms use, in return for
 wages/rent/interest/profit (the firm's cost).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\begin_layout Section
GDP and economic growth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Gross domestic product
\series default
 is the total market value of the final goods and services produced in a
 country in a time period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\series bold
final good
\series default
 is bought by its final user, whereas an 
\series bold
intermediate good
\series default
 is used to make another good.
 Intermediate goods aren't in GDP because that's double counting.
 Final/intermediate sometimes depends on context.
 Financial instruments and secondhand goods are not part of GDP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Real GDP
\series default
 has prices adjusted for a fixed reference year.
 
\series bold
Nominal GDP
\series default
 is not real.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Real GDP per person
\series default
 is a useful metric.
 
\series bold
Potential GDP
\series default
 is the maximum real GDP that can be obtained without shortages of the factors
 of production (inflation comes with that).
 The 
\series bold
Lucas wedge
\series default
 illustrates the cost of a slowdown in productivity growth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
business cycle
\series default
 is an irregular periodic cycle of 
\series bold
expansion
\series default
 and 
\series bold
recession
\series default
 with turning points at the 
\series bold
peak
\series default
 and 
\series bold
trough
\series default
.
 Recessions last at least two quarters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To compare GDPs between different countries, can be more accurate to use
 
\series bold
PPP
\series default
 (purchasing power parity) prices: calculate the second country's GDP using
 the same prices as those of the first.

\begin_layout Standard
This gives us two equivalent ways of measuring GDP.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{GDP}=Y=C+I+G+X-M
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gross means before subtracting depreciation (contrast with

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
The expenditure approach
\series default
:
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset

The income approach
\series default
:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{GDP}=Y=W+OFI+D

other factor incomes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (profits, interest, farmers' income, income from non-incorporated businesses),
 and 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset


\series default
 is depreciation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Indirect tax
\series default
 is sales tax paid by consumers.
 
\series bold
Direct tax
\series default
 is income tax.
 Governments sometimes pay a 
\series bold
subsidy
\series default
 to producers to make a good cheaper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Statistical discrepancy
\series default
: the two approaches will result in slightly different results, about 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1\%$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Chianed-dollar method
\series default
: Used to calculate real GDP in a consistent way by computing the average
 growth rate between adjacent years, with each year's products measured
 at the other year's prices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Things GDP misses out on
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Household production
\series default
: Household activities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Underground economic activity
\series default
: Illegal stuff.
 Canada: about 5-15%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Leisure time
\series default
: This is a good too, but we don't count it
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Environmental quality
\series default
: GDP does not take environmental damage into account, but we like a good
 environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Also
\series default
: political freedom, social justice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This means that real GDP underestimates total production, but the growth
 in GDP overestimates the growth rate of total production (since some production
 replaces household production).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Unemployment and inflation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unemployment is a problem because it results in:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lost income and production â€” a person is not put to their full use, and
 also doesn't make money
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lost human capital â€” a person's career is permanently damaged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is a breakdown of the population.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The population contains a
\series bold
 working-age population
\series default
 (15+)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
...
 which contains a 
\series bold
labour force
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
...
 which consists of 
\series bold
unemployed
\series default
, and 
\series bold
employed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
...
 which consists of 
\series bold
full-time
\series default
, and 
\series bold
part-time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
...
 which consists of 
\series bold
voluntary 
\series default
and 
\series bold
involuntary
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that unemployed people must be one of:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
On temporary layoff with expectation of recall
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Has no job, has looked for past four weeks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Has job that won't start for more than four weeks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyone else is not considered to be part of the labour force.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Four rates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Unemployment rate
\series default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Involuntary part-time rate
\series default
: involuntary / labour force
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold

Discouraged searchers
\series default
: Stopped because of repeated failure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Long-term future starts
\series default
: Job starts in more than four weeks.
 Excluding them from the labour force may underestimate true unemployment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Involuntary part-timers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most costly unemployment comes from job loss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Unemployment cycles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Frictional unemployment
\series default
: Results from duration of job matching, people entering and leaving the
 labour force, and the creation/destruction of jobs.
 Also exacerbated by better unemployment benefits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Structural unemployment
\series default
: Skill requirements or job locations change.
 Lasts longer than frictional.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Cyclical unemployment
\series default
: Business cycle is low.
 Results in people being laid off then rehired when expansion begins again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Natural unemployment
\series default
 consists of frictional and structural.
 
\series bold
Full employment
\series default
 means the unemployment rate is the natural unemployment rate.
 Most important factors that influence this are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Population age distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Scale of structural change
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Real wage rate
\series default
: things like 
\series bold
minimum wage rate
\series default
 and 
\series bold
efficiency wage
\series default
 (premium to retain talent) increase natural unemployment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Unemployment benefits: increase unemployment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
output gap
\series default
 is the difference between real GDP and potential GDP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Inflation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
price level
\series default
 is the average level of prices; inverse value of money.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Inflation
\series default
 is a rising price level.
 
\series bold
Deflation
\series default
 is a falling price level.
 The effects are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Redistributes income
\series default
: Inflation means wages buy less.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Redistributes wealth
\series default
: Inflation is good for borrowers and bad for lenders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Inflation 
\series bold
increases real GDP and employment
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Diverts resources from production
\series default
: Unpredictable inflation or deflation turns the economy into a casino.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Hyperinflation
\series default
: Inflation of over 50% a month that brings the economy revolution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Measuring inflation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
CPI
\series default
 (consumer price index) is the price of the goods in a specially constructed
 CPI basket, relative to a base period.
 Data is collected through the 
\series bold
monthly price survey
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
inflation rate
\series default
 can be measured by the yearly change in CPI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sources of bias in the CPI include:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
New goods bias
\series default
: Arrival of new technologies that are more dominant but more expensive
 biases inflation upward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Quality change bias
\series default
: Arrival of better, more expensive things biases inflation upward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Commodity substitution bias
\series default
: When prices increase, people buy cheaper alternatives.
 CPI basket is not rebalanced, so the increase in prices is overstated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Outlet substitution bias
\series default
: When prices increase, people shop at cheaper stores.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bias is about 
\begin_inset Formula $+0.6$
\end_inset

% per year for Canada.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Other price indices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
GDP deflator
\series default

\end_inset

By combining this with GDP, we see that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $T-G$

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Interest rates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Nominal
\series default
 is before adjusting for inflation; 
\series bold
real
\series default
 is after.
 Interest rates in this section are generally real.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Supply and demand of loans
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The higher the interest rate, the more supply and the less demand there
 is for loanable funds.
 These are represented in two curves, 
\series bold
DLF
\series default
 (demand for loanable funds) and 
\series bold
SLF
\series default
 (supply of loanable funds).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The supply of loanable funds also increases when households have 
\series bold
more disposable income
\series default
, when households have 
\series bold
less expected future income
\series default
 (since they'll save less), when households have 
\series bold
less wealth
\series default
 (because people see more need to save ???), and when 
\series bold
default risk is lower
\series default
 (???).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this way, the interest rate is regulated by the supply and demand for

Effect of government
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\series bold
budget surplus
\series default
 increases the supply, which decreases the interest rate and the private
 supply (
\series bold
PSLF
\series default
) and increases private demand (
\series bold
PDLF
\series default
).
 A 
\series bold
budget deficit
\series default
 increases the demand, which increases the interest rate and the amount
 of private supply but decreases private demand (the 
\series bold
crowding-out effect
\series default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
Ricardo-Barro effect
\series default
 says that government budget doesn't actually affect the interest rate,
 because rational taxpayers save more.
 Most economists find this interesting but extreme.

\begin_layout Section
Money (ch24)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Money
\series default
 is a 
\series bold
means of payment
\series default
 and a 
\series bold
medium of exchange
\series default
 that overcomes the requirement for a 
\series bold
double coincidence of wants
\series default
 as occurs in 
\series bold
barter
\series default
.
 It's also a 
\series bold
unit of account
\series default
 (unit of measurement for prices) and a 
\series bold
store of value
\series default
.
 Money today is mostly in the form of 
\series bold
currency
\series default
 and 
\series bold
deposits
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Canada has two measures of money: 
\series bold
M1
\series default
, which includes currency and chequable deposits and 
\series bold
M2
\series default
 which additionally includes non-chequable deposits and fixed term deposits.
 Stuff the government owns is not considered money.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stuff that 
\series bold
isn't money
\series default
 by our definition: cheques, credit cards.
 They're just means of payment.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three depository institutions make up Canada's money: 
\series bold
chartered banks
\series default
 such as RBC, CIBC, and BMO; 
\series bold
credit unions
\series default
, and 
\series bold
trust/mortgage loan companies
\series default
.
 We will call all these things 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chartered banks use their funds for four types of assets: 
\series bold
reserves
\series default
 of about 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5-1\%$
\end_inset

, 
\series bold
liquid assets
\series default
 such as treasury bills,

loans
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Banks provide these benefits:

\series bold
Create liquidity
\series default
: they borrow short and lend long
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Pool risk

: one default doesn't have that big of an effect
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Lower cost of borrowing
\series default
: by acting as a central counterparty
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Lower cost of monitoring borrowers
\series default
: by doing it efficiently
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is all 
\series bold
fractional reserve banking
\series default
, which is riskier but don't worry, 
\series bold
Basel III

\series bold
100 percent reserve banking
\series default

Financial innovation
\series default
 is when banks create things like variable-rate mortgages and sell mortgage-back
ed securities.

\begin_layout Subsection
The Bank of Canada
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is our 
\series bold
central bank
\series default
; it acts as a bank to banks and the government; it is a 
\series bold
lender of last resort
\series default
, and it is the 
\series bold
sole issuer of bank notes
\series default
.
 It owns two assets: Treasury bills, and loans to depository institutions
 (in times of crisis).
 It has two liabilities: Bank of Canada notes (dollar bills!) and depository
 institution deposits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our 
\series bold
monetary base
\series default
 is made up of the Bank of Canada's liabilities and the coins issued by
 the Royal Canadian Mint.
\end_layout

 â€” it anchors other short-term interest rates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Creating money
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Banks create money by making loans.
 This created money is limited by the monetary base, and further limited
 by the bank's 
\series bold
desired reserves
\series default
 (reserves that it plans to hold) and the 
\series bold
desired currency holding
\series default
.
 The 
\series bold
currency drain 
\series default
ratio
\series bold
 
\series default
is the ratio of currency to deposits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The banking system creates money as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The monetary base is increased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Bank reserves are increased, creating excess reserves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Banks lend out their excess reserves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The quantity of money increases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
New deposits are used to make payments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Some money is lost through currency drain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Banks have less excess reserves than before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
money multiplier
\series default
 is the amount of money created by a change in the monetary base.
 In Canada, the M1 multiplier has ranged from 
\begin_inset Formula $5.5-10.4$
\end_inset

 and the M2 multiplier has ranged from 
\begin_inset Formula $16-19.5$
\end_inset

.
 It is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
mm & =M/MB\\
 & =(D+C)/(R+C)\\
 & =(1+C/D)/(R/D+C/D)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is the amount of money, 
\begin_inset Formula $MB$
\end_inset

 is the monetary base, 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 is deposits, 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is currency, and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is bank reserves.
 (This implies 
\begin_inset Formula $C/D$
\end_inset

 is the currency drain ratio and 
\begin_inset Formula $R/D$
\end_inset

 is the reserve ratio.)

Price level: The more expensive things are, the more money we hold onto
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Nominal interest rate: The more we can make by investing, the less money
 we hold onto
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Real GDP: The more we spend, the more we must have held onto
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Financial innovation: More convenient means of payment that don't count
 as money means we hold onto less money
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Quantity theory of money
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It states that increasing the quantity of money eventually increases the
 price level proportionally.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
velocity of circulation
\series default
 is the average number of times each dollar is used (to buy GDP components)
 per year.
 It is given by the 
\series bold
equation of exchange
\series default
:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MV=GDP=PY
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is the price level, 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 is the real GDP, and 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is the quantity of money.
 Expressing this in terms of rates gives us
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\text{Inflation rate}= & \phantom{+}\text{Money growth rate}\\
 & +\text{Rate of velocity change}\\
 & -\text{Real GDP growth rate}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where the rate of velocity change is approximately
