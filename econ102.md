# ECON 102: Introduction to Macroeconomics

Prof: Wokia Kumase.

- "I was expecting to have a full room"
- Grading is 25% midterm 1, 25% midterm 2, 50% final.
- Exams will be multiple choice.
- Midterms are not cumulative.
- Expect: first 4 chapters, next 4 chapters, everything.

## Chapter 1

- **Scarcity** is the source of all economic problems.
- **Economics** studies how to allocate limited resources to satisfy unlimited
  human wants.
- **Microeconomics** focuses on the choices of individuals and businesses.
- **Macroeconomics** focuses on the choices and performance of countries.

- Principles
  - 1. All decisions involve tradeoffs.
    - Society faces the important tradeoff of efficiency vs. equity.
      - To achieve greater equity, can redistribute wealth -- but this reduces
        incentive to produce, reducing efficiency and shrinking the overall
        pie.
  - 2. Cost is what you give up.
    - Opportunity costs are relevant.
    - In economics, nothing is free. Delve deeper and there is a cost,
      opportunity or otherwise.
  - 3. Rational people often think at the margin.
    - That is, marginal changes.
  - 4. People respond to incentives.
  - 5. Trade makes everyone better off.
  - 6. Markets usually organize trade well.
    - The **invisible hands** of economics:
      - Prices are determined by the interaction of buyers and sellers.
      - Such prices usually maximize society's total economic well-being.
    - Without money, you need a **double coincidence of wants** for trade to
      happen.
  - 7. Governments can improve market outcomes.
    - Markets can fail due to:
      - Externalities, like pollution
      - Market power, like monopolies
      in which case public policy may increase efficiency.
    - Or, can use policy to increase equity.
    - Tax and welfare redistribute the pie.
  - 8. A country's wealth depends on its ability to produce.
  - 9. Prices rise when the government prints too much money.
    - This is called **inflation**.
  - 10. Society faces a short-term tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.

## Chapter 2

- Economists have two roles:
  - Scientists: Explain how the world works.
  - Policy advisors: Try to improve it.
- Use **models** that incorporate simplifying **assumptions** to study the world.

- **Circular flow diagram**: Shows the flow of dollars through markets.
  - Two types of actors: households and firms
  - Two markets: goods and services; factors of production
  - Factors of production are: land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship
    - Returns are:
      - Labour: wages.
      - Land: rent.
      - Capital: interest.
      - Entrepreneurship: capital.
  - TODO: Memorize this.
  - (Firms sell | households buy) goods and services, in return for (revenue | spending).
  - (Households provide | Firms use) factors of production, in return for (wages/rent/profit | income).

- **Production possibilities frontier**: Shows the possible production of goods
  of various types given available resources and technology
  - (Slides) Opportunity wine cost of cloth is lower in England. England is
    "better" at cloth than France, and France is "better" at wine than England.
  - Better technology shifts the PPF outward
  - Straight line implies similar production mechanisms; bow-shaped (concave
    down) implies different skills and increasing opportunity costs

- Scientists vs. policy makers.
  - Scientists make positive statements: "This has happened"
  - Policy advisors make normative statements: "We should do this"
  - Only positive statements can be confirmed or refuted.
  - Economists often disagree about the validity of theories, and have
    different personal values. So they often have normative views.

- This is the end of microeconomics review.
