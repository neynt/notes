# CS 343: Concurrency

Professor: Peter Buhr

## 1. Advanced control flow

Omitted.

## 2. Exceptions

- Static/Dynamic Call/Return
- Static propagation
  - Sequel
- Dynamic propagation
  - Termination
  - Resumption `_Resume`

## 3. Coroutine

- State:
  - Execution location
  - Exeuction state (each coroutine has its own stack)
  - Execution status (active / inactive / terminated)
- A Life With N Stacks
- Semi-coroutine: Asymmetrical.
- Full-coroutine: Symmetrical.
- Linearization: Making loops flat.
- Pull coroutine: Generates things in next().
- Push coroutine: Accepts things in next().
- Leverage the coroutine zen.
- Exception handling: `_Throw`, `_Suspend ... [_At]`, `_Catch`, `_CatchResume UnhandledException`
- For assignment: `_Enable` in `main()`.

## 4. µC++ EHM

Omitted.

## 5. Concurrency

- Things that are things:
  - Thread: Execution path
  - Process: Program component with a thread
  - Task: Reduced process. Lightweight process
- Thread states: new, ready, running, blocked, halted
- CPUs run kernel threads run user threads
- Speedup is typically sublinear or (badly) nonlinear
- Amdahl's law: SC = 1 / ((1 - P) + P/C)
- Concurrency in µC++:
  - Include `<uCobegin.h>`
  - COBEGIN BEGIN END ... BEGIN END COEND
    - Can represent some lattices
  - auto x = START, WAIT(x)
  - COFOR(var, 0, 10) loops for row from 0 to 9
  - `_Task` objects
- Mutual Exclusion Game
  - Rules:
    - 1. Safety: Only one thread in something's critical section.
    - 2. Threads may run at any speed, in any order.
    - 3. Threads may not entering/leaving a critical section cannot prevent
         other threads from entering it.
    - 4. Liveness: No indefinite postponement / livelock.
    - 5. No starvation: Threads that have started must eventually enter CS.

## 6. Locks.

- Know this for A3Q3.
- Two types: spinning and blocking.
- Spinning:
  - No yield
  - Yield: Yields after a single failed check.
- Blocking: Must cooperate
  - Synchronization
    - Condition
    - Barrier
  - Semaphore
    - Binary
    - Counting
  - Mutex
    - Owner
  - (Many others)
- Mutex lock
  - Type of blocking lock
  - Single acquisition: Acquirer cannot acquire locko again
  - Multiple acquisition: Acquirer can acquire lock multiple times
  - May require only one release, or as many releases as acquires
  - Implementation details:
    - Don't block when holding the lock: Release lock before blocking
    - Race between blocking and unblocking tasks.
    - Magic: yieldNoSchedule( lock );
  - Barging: Acquiring tasks can barge ahead of the released task.
  - Barging avoidance: Hold inUse flag between releasing and unblocking task
  - Barging prevention: Hold lock between releasing and unblocking task
  - In uC++: uOwnerLock
    - To use: `uOwnerLock lock; lock.acquire(); try { ... } _Finally { lock.release(); }`
    - Can also use RAII
  - Stream locks: osacquire( cout )
- Synchronization lock
  - To block tasks waiting for synchronization.
  - External locking: External lock protects task list. Very dangerous
  - Internal locking: Lock is part of state.
- A3: Producer Consumer problem, our good ol' friend.
