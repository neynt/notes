# CS 343: Concurrency

Professor: Peter Buhr

- Static/Dynamic Call/Return
- Static propagation
  - Sequel
- Dynamic propagation
  - Termination
  - Resumption `_Resume`
- 3. Coroutine
  - State:
    - Execution location
    - Exeuction state (each coroutine has its own stack)
    - Execution status (active / inactive / terminated)
  - A Life With N Stacks
  - Semi-coroutine: Asymmetrical.
  - Full-coroutine: Symmetrical.
- Linearization: Making loops flat.
- Pull coroutine: Generates things in next().
- Push coroutine: Accepts things in next().
- Leverage the coroutine zen.
- Exception handling: `_Throw`, `_Suspend ... [_At]`, `_Catch`, `_CatchResume` UnhandledException
- For assignment: `_Enable` in `main()`.
