# CS 348: Databases

Professor: Grant Weddell

## 1. Introduction

- Data is facts.
- We mainly deal with **persistent**, not **volatile** data.
- Data: Large persistent collection of information with efficient get and update.
- Database management system: Set of programs that manage a database.
- Schema: how data is organized
- Three level schema architecture:
  - External (view): What applications see
  - Conceptual: Logical structure of data
  - Physical: Files, devices, storage algorithms
- Data independence: DBMS provides an abstract data model
  - Physical: immune to changes in storage structures
  - Logical: immune to changes in data organization
- Transaction: Application-specified atomic, durable unit of work
- ACID:
  - Atomic: all or nothing
  - Consistent: makes sense
  - Isolated: non-interfering
  - Durable: changes stay
- Data definition language (DDL): for schemas
- Data manipulation language (DML): for queries and updates

## 2. The relational model

- All information is organized in a number of relations.
- Components:
  - Universe: Set of values D, with quality (=)
  - Relation:
    - schema: name R, arity k
    - instance: relation R sube D^k
  - Database:
    - schema: set of relation schemes
    - instance: relation Ri for Ri
  - Notation: signature rho = (R1, ..., Rn), instance D = (D, =, R1, ..., Rn)
- Valuation: Maps variable names to values in the universe.
- Complete semantics: TODO, involves |=
- Integrity constraints: Stuff that must be true in a valid database instance
- View: An integrity constraint that extends the DB schema, creating a virtual table
- Unsafe queries: Can have infinite answers.
- Domain-independent query: Satisfies a thing. (TODO)
  - Thm: Answers to these queries only contain values that exist in R1, ..., Rk (the active domain)
- Range-restricted query: A class of domain-independent queries.
  - diq can be rewritten as an equivalent rrq.
- Computational properties
  - Relational calculus is not Turing complete, since every query evaluation terminates
  - **Data complexity**: complexity in the size of the database for a *fixed query*
    - in PTIME, LOGSPACE, AC₀
  - **Combined complexity**: in PSPACE, but not PTIME (You can express SAT)
- TODO: A bunch of stuff went over your head, review this later

## 3. SQL

- Three parts of the language:
  - DML: Data manipulation language
  - DDL: Data definition language
  - DLC: Data control language
- SQL data types: integer, smallint, decimal(m,n), float, char(n), varchar(n), date, time
- SELECT results FROM tables WHERE condition
  - `SELECT DISTINCT * FROM author;`
    - Selects all authors
  - `SELECT DISTINCT r1.publication FROM wrote r1, wrote r2 WHERE r1.publication = r2.publication and r1.author != r2.author;
    - Selects all publications with at least two authors
  - `SELECT DISTINCT title FROM publication, book WHERE publication.pubid = book.pubid`
    - Selects titles of all books
- UNION, EXCEPT, INTERSECT
  - Set operations
  - Use like: `(select distinct pubid from book) union (select distinct pubid from journal)
- WITH
  - Used for subqueries
  - Use like: `WITH thing AS (SELECT xxx) SELECT yyy FROM thing`
  - Can also subquery inline: `SELECT yyy FROM (SELECT xxx)`
- First-order SQL shortcomings
  - Some queries are hard to write (need syntactic sugar)
  - No counting (need aggregation)
  - No "path in graph" (need recursion)
- WHERE subqueries
  - WHERE attr IN ( Q )
  - WHERE attr NOT IN ( Q )
  - WHERE attr op SOME ( Q )
  - WHERE attr op ALL ( Q )
  - WHERE EXISTS ( Q )
  - WHERE NOT EXISTS ( Q )
  - Parametric subqueries: basically you can access upper scope
- Bag operations
  - UNION ALL
  - EXCEPT ALL
  - INTERSECT ALL

## 2017 Oct 6

- Miami is probably underwater (SIZZLING LIKE A STEAK)
- We will be reviewing all content today next class.
- Questions that can be expressed in the relational calculus:
  - Can't tell you exactly but I can give major hints
  - There are exactly five of them
  - Heavily weighted towards earlier questions
  - Three big characteristics of SQL that cannot be relational calculused:
    - sorting (ORDER BY)
    - multiset semantics -- relational calculus is set semantics
    - Aggregate functions: unbounded use of SUM, COUNT
      - note: MAX and MIN are fine
      - unbounded means the result can grow arbitrarily large
    - Note: NULL semantics MAY still be allowed
- Every class has at least one schedule
- cnum is varchar(5); guaranteed 2 letters + 3 numbers
- It's important that you thoroughly appreciated the metadata
- select distinct c.cname from course c where c.cnum like 'CS%'
  - yes this can be expressed in the relational calculus
  - x = y is also ok
    - either term can be a variable, constant, or an expression
    - <, <=, !=, >=, > also allowed (atomic constructs)
  - this would be, in the RC:
    - { <c.cname> | ∃ c.cnum . course(c.cnum, c.cname) ∧ c.cname like 'CS%' }
      - we're allowed to use LIKE
  - Current term === !exists mark for some class in the term
- #4: allow students who have never taken a CS course
- metahint: in case of ambiguity, lean toward solution involving less code
- #4 can be RC'd
- can assume every student has an enrollment
- "completed two years": year >= 3
- Add comments with perceived ambiguities for mark insurance
- We will make grading mistakes
- #10: "The % of profs in AM who are ... divided by % of profs in PM ..."
- The collating sequence of 24h time string matches "earlier in the day"

- Authors examples
- "get ids of authors who have never authored a book"
  - is this a conjunctive query? no, because of "never" --> implied "for every"
  - ugly:
    - select distinct a.aid from author a where NOT EXISTS (
      - select * from book b where exists (
        - select * from wrote w where w.author = a.aid and w.publication = b.pubid
      - )
    - )
  - better ("alternative formulation"):
    - select distinct a.aid from author a where NOT EXISTS (
      - select * from book b, wrote w
        - where w.author = a.aid and w.publication = b.pubid
      - )
    - )
  - rel calc:
    - { <a.aid> | ¬∃ pid, pub, year . (book(pid, pub, year) ∧ wrote(a.aid, pid)) }
    - can also change `not exists` to `forall not`
  - can collapse exists. cannot collapse NOT exists.
  - ALWAYS PUT DISTINCT, don't worry about performance!!
- "get ids of authors who have never authored more journals than books in any year"
  - Try to start:
    - select distinct a.aid from author a where ???
  - LET THERE BE SUBRESULTS
    - T1: (aid, year, bc (book count))
      - with T1(aid, year, bc) as (
        - select distinct a.aid, b.year, count(*)  <-- unbounded count!
        - ... from author a, wrote w, book b
        - ... where w.author = a.aid and w.publication = b.pubid
        - ... group by a.aid, b.year
      - )
    - T2: (aid, year, jc (journal count))
      - with T2(aid, year, bc) as (
        -
      - )
  - Then, we can use
    - select distinct a.aid from author a where not exists (
      - select * from T1 t1, T2 t2 where t1.aid = t2.aid and t1.year = t2.year and 
      - ... t1.aid = a.aid and t1.bc < t2.jc
    - )

## Application programming and SQL

- For A2, we will use Static Embedded SQL Protocol
- EXEC SQL WHATEVER;
- It's horrendous

## Week 5: DYNESQL

- SQL/PSM: Persistent Stored Modules. Server-side executed code.
- `db2 prep name.sql` preprocesses sqc files.
- Indicator vars:
  - smallint ind; SELECT ... INTO :thing INDICATOR :ind FROM ...;
  - If ind < 0, then :thing is NULL.
- Multiple tuples
  - EXEC SQL DECLARE cursor CURSOR FOR SELECT ...;
  - Then, iterate as follows:
  - EXEC SQL OPEN cursor;
    EXEC SQL WHENEVER NOT FOUND GO TO end;
    for (;;) { EXEC SQL FETCH thing INTO :thing; do things to thing; };
    end: EXEC SQL CLOSE cursor;
- No nested cursors preferably
- Stored procedures:
  - Define:
      CREATE FUNCTION sumThing(dept CHAR(3))
        RETURNS DECIMAL(9, 2)
        LANGUAGE SQL
      RETURN
        SELECT ...
  - Use:
      SELECT sumThing(deptno) AS sal ...
  - Table-valued fn:
      CREATE FUNCTION ...
        RETURNS TABLE(salary DECIMAL(9,2))
        LANGUAGE SQL
      RETURN
        SELECT salary FROM ...
  - Can also have `DECLARE ... CONDITION FOR SQLSTATE '02000'`;
  - Can also have `DECLARE EXIT HANDLERL FOR not_found SET rating=-1`;
  - Can also have `IF X THEN ... ELSEIF Y THEN ... ELSE ... END IF`

## Week 6: DYNESQL

- Unsafe execution:
  - EXEC SQL EXECUTE IMMEDIATE :string;
- Safe execution:
  - EXEC SQL PREPARE stmt FROM :string;
  - EXEC SQL EXECUTE stmt USING :var1, ..., :vark;
- Using cursors with premeditated queries:
  - EXEC SQL DECLARE cursor CURSOR FOR stmt;
    EXEC SQL OPEN cname USING :var1, ..., :vark;
    EXEC SQL FETCH cname INTO :out1, ..., :outn;
    EXEC SQL CLOSE cname;
- Dynamic descriptor area:
  - For unknown number/types of variables
  - ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR descr
  - GET DESCRIPTOR descr what
  - SET DESCRIPTOR descr what 
  - DESCRIBE (INPUT|OUTPUT) stmt INTO descr
- SQLDA: SQL Description Area
