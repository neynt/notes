- Eoin Woods: Software architecture is the set of design decisions which, if made incorrectly, may cause your project to be cancelled.
- A **functional requirement** (FR) is what the system has to do.
- A **nonfunctional requirement** (NFR) is how well the system is at being a system.
- System architecture stakeholders: Architects, Developers, Testers, Managers, Customers, Users, Vendors.
- Only **principal** design decisions affect the architecture.
- Architecture consists of processing, data, and interaction.
- Types of connectors:
  - Procedure call
  - Shared memory
