# SE 464: Software architecture

Professor: Werner Dietl

## 1: What is software architecture? (2017 Sep 07)

- Architecture is:
  - Structure
  - Communication
  - Nonfunctional requirements
- NOT:
  - Development
  - Algorithms or data structures (no having fun)

## 2: Architecture (2017 Sep 12)

- How to choose between alternatives
  - Fitness for purpose
  - Cost of production (parts, labour, capital)
  - Cost of operation
  - Fitness for future
- Architecture examples:
  - Logical web architecture (e.g. webpage link graph)
  - Physical web architecture (computers and a cloud)
  - Dynamic web architecture (requests between browser and servers)
- Eoin Woods: "Bad architecture will cancel your project" (paraphrased) 
- Functional / nonfunctional:
  - FR: What the system has to do.
  - NFR: How the system is supposed to be.
- System architecture stakeholders: ADT MVC U
  - Architects, Developers, Testers, Managers, Customers, Users, Vendors.
- Only **principal** design decisions affect the architecture.
- Architecture consists of processing, data, and interaction.
- Architecture elements:
  - Components (box that contains processing/data, has an interface, dependencies)
  - Connectors (arrows between boxes)
- Types of connectors:
  - Procedure call
  - Shared memory
  - Message passing
  - Streaming
  - Distribution
  - Wrapper/adaptor
- **Configuration/topology**: Associations between components and connectors
- **Deployment**: Map components to hardware
- **Incidental difficulties**: Can overcome
- **Essential difficulties**: Cannot easily overcome
  - Complexity: Grows super-linearly with program size
  - Conformity: System depends on environment
  - Changeability: Software is easily modified
  - Intangibility: Software isn't physical
- Attacks on complexity
  - Use high-level languages
  - Use dev tools and environments
  - Reuse components
  - Use development strategies: Incremental, evolutionary, spiral
  - Emphasize design from outset

## 3: Architecture II (2017 Sep 14)

Note: nonfunctional property stuff moved to next lecture.

- Prescriptive v. Descriptive
  - **Prescriptive architecture**: Intended
  - **Descriptive architecture**: Implemented
- **Architectural evolution**: Architecture changes. Ideally prescriptive modified first. Often not the case.
- **Architectural degradation**
  - **Drift**: Does not conflict with existing design decisions
  - **Erosion**: Does
- **Architectural recovery**: Recovering architecture from source or binaries
- **Topological goals**: Minimize coupling, maximize cohesion.
- **Abstraction**: Hide unnecessary detail.
  - Control abstraction: Structured programming.
  - Data abstraction: Abstract data types.
- **Decomposition**: Top-down abstraction.
- **Conway's law**: "Software structure imitates org structure." (paraphrased)
- **4+1 view model**:
  - Logical → (Development, Process) → Physical
  - ... all bound together by Scenarios
- Architecture ...:
  - Model: Documents design decisions
  - View: Set of related design decisions
  - Visualization: Depicts view to stakeholder
- UML stuff. (USE REAL UML)
  - **Component diagram**: Components and relationships.
  - **Sequence diagram**: Inter-component collaboration for specific scenarios.
  - **Deployment diagram**: Map components to physical devices.
  - **Statechart diagram**: Formal description of system behavior.

## 4: Nonfunctional properties (2017 Sep 15)

- Non-functional properties
  - **Efficiency**: System is performant.
    - Components should: be small, have simple interfaces, have multiple interfaces, separate data from processing, separate data from metadata
    - Connectors should: be carefully selected, usually not be broadcast, async, location-aware
    - Topology should: keep collaborators close
  - **Complexity**: Amount of stuff you have to understand
    - Components should: separate concerns, isolate interaction from functionality, be cohesive, isolate data format changes
    - Connectors should: isolate interaction from functionality, restrict interactions for each connector
    - Topology should: not have useless dependencies, use hierarchical decomposition
  - **Scalability**: System stays performant as it gets more users
  - **Heterogeneity**: System is made of disparate parts
    - Components should: be focused, have simple interfaces, not be heterogeneous, have distributed/replicated data sources
    - Connectors should: be explicit, be simple
    - Topology should: not have bottlenecks, have data close to consumer, be location transparent
  - **Portability**: System can execute on multiple platforms
  - **Evolvability**: System can satisfy new requirements, environments
    - Components should: same as complexity
    - Connectors should: have clear responsibilities, be flexible
    - Topology should: not have implicit connectors, be location transparent
  - **Dependability**: System should keep working
    - Reliable: System doesn't fail over time
    - Available: System is up NOW
    - Robust: System handles weird conditions
    - Fault-tolerant: System handles failures
    - Survivable: System handles threats
    - Safe: System doesn't kill people
    - Components should: have few external deps, support reflection, handle exceptions
    - Connectors should: be explicit, provide interaction guarantees
    - Topology should: have no single points of failure, allow backups, allow health monitoring, allow dynamic adaptation
- **Architectural pattern**: Set of design decisions.
  - Three tiered system
    - Front tier: User interface
    - Middle tier: Application logic
    - Back tier: Data storage
  - Model view controller
    - user CALLS controller UPDATES model NOTIFIES view IS DISPLAYED TO user
  - Sense compute control
    - forever: read sensors; compute outputs; send outputs

## 5: Architectural styles (2017 Sep 19)

- **Architectural style**: Named set of design decisions that are generally good.
- **Pure** architectural style: Archetypical. Rarely used.
- Examples of styles:
  - **Layered**
    - Each layer exposes an API to be used by layers above
    - Examples: operating systems, OSI 7 layers
    - Advantages: increasing abstraction levels, evolvable
    - Disadvantages: not universally applicable, performance
    - Layers may have to be skipped
    - **Client-server**
      - Components are clients and servers
      - Servers don't know clients; clients know servers
      - Use RPC connectors over the network
    - **Virtual machine**
  - **Dataflow**
    - **Batch sequential**
      - Programs executed in order
      - Like pipe and filter but each component must process ALL its input
    - **Pipe and filter**
      - Process data streams
      - Components are filters
      - Connectors are pipes
      - Examples: UNIX shell, signal processing, distributed systems, parallel programming
  - **Shared memory**
    - **Blackboard**
      - Central data repository, and components operate on it
      - Examples: AI, IDEs, compilers
    - **Rule-based**
      - Inference engine distinguishes facts and queries
      - Example: P R O L O G

## 6: Architectural styles II (2017 Sep 21)

- More examples of styles:
  - Interpreter
    - Interpreter
      - Parse and execute commands
      - Components: command interpreter, program state, UI
      - Connectors: Closely bound. Direct procedure calls, shared state.
      - Examples: Lisp.
    - Mobile code
      - Language-based
        - Object-oriented
        - Procedural
  - Implicit invocation
    - Pubsub
      - Separate publishers and subscribers
      - Many event streams
    - Event-based
      - Everyone can publish and receive events to a global bus
  - Peer-to-peer
    - Like bittorrent. M e s h  networks
- CORBA
  - Common Object Request Broker Architecture
  - (Good idea, ruined by design by committee)
  - Components are objects
  - Connectors are (remote) method calls
  - Data elements are arguments, return values, and exceptions
  - Topology: Directed graph of calls
  - Additional constraints:
    - Data must be serializable
    - Callers must deal with exceptions
    - Transparent to location, platform, language
- Summary:
  - These are pure styles
  - Architectures can differ even for the same style, and styles can be combined
- Design recovery
  - Syntactic clustering
    - Static analysis of code entities
    - May miss relationships from dynamic information
  - Semantic clustering
    - Dynamic analysis
    - Often requires human understanding
- Greenfield design: This is us. You Make Everything!

## 7: Architecture modeling (2017 Sep 22)

- Model: Set of all design decisions that comprise system architecture
- What do we model?
  - Components
  - Connectors
  - Interfaces
  - Configurations
  - Rationale
  - Static vs. dynamic aspects
    - Static aspects do not change as the system runs
    - Dynamic do
  - Functional vs. non-functional aspects
    - Functional: "The system does it"
    - Non-functional: "The system does it well in these ways"
- Models should be:
  - Unambiguous (No more than one interpretation)
  - Accurate (Correct)
  - Precise (Not ambiguous)
- Views and viewpoints:
  - We can't capture everything in a single model, so use many views
  - Versions of the model that capture the design decisions from a particular perspective
- Viewpoints:
  - Logical
  - Physical
  - Deployment
  - Concurrency
  - Behavioral
- **Consistent** views don't disagree with each other
  - Common inconsistencies:
    - Direct (e.g. 2 vs. 3)
    - Refinement (high-level and low-level disagree)
    - Static vs. dynamic: e.g. topology vs behavior spec
    - Dynamic vs. dynamic: e.g. state vs. sequence diagram
    - Functional vs. non-functional
- Evaluating modeling approaches
  - Scope and purpose
  - Basic elements
  - Style
  - Static and dynamic aspects
  - Dynamic modeling
  - Non-functional aspects
  - Ambiguity
  - Accuracy
  - Precise
  - Viewpoints
  - Viewpoint consistency
- Survey of modeling approaches:
  - Generic approaches (Natural language, Powerpoint, UML)
  - Early architecture description languages (Darwin, Rapide, Wright)
  - Domain- and style-specific languages (Koala, Weave, AADL)
  - Extensible architecture description languages (Acme, ADML, xADL)
- UML
  - 13 notations
  - For static AND dynamic aspects
  - Advantages:
    - Support for diverse array of viewpoints
    - Common
    - Tool support
  - Disadvantages:
    - Needs customization to reduce ambiguity
    - Hard to determine if views are consistent
    - Hard to capture foreign concepts/views
  - Static structures:
    - Component diagrams
    - Deployment diagrams
    - Class diagrams
  - Dynamic behavior:
    - Sequence diagrams
    - Use case diagrams
    - State machine diagrams
- Architecture description languages
  - Entire programming languages made not for writing programs, but for describing them
  - This is awful tbh

## 8: Security & Chrome (2017 Sep 26)

- Security words:
  - Confidentiality: Only the right people can access stuff
  - Integrity: Only the right people can change stuff, and only in allowed ways
  - Availability: The right people can do stuff all the time
- Design principles:
  - Least privilege: Each component only has privileges it needs.
  - Fail-safe defaults: Deny access by default.
  - Economy of mechanism: Security mechanisms should be simple.
  - Complete mediation: Every access must be permitted.
  - Open design: Don't rely on secrecy.
  - Separation of privilege: Require multiple parties. (nuke launch keys)
  - Least common mechanism: Limit resource sharing to a few mechanisms.
  - Psychological acceptability: Don't annoy the user.
  - Defense in depth: Multiple layers.
- Architectural access control models
  - Discretionary access control
    - Map from (user, resource) to set of permissions
  - Mandatory access control 
    - Map from user to clearance level; documents have a minimum clearance level
- Baddies
  - Impersonation: "I am Bob."
  - Fraudulent actions: "I will take your money and not ship the items."
  - Misrepresentation: "Bob is unreliable."
  - Collusion: "Bob is unreliable." "Bob is unreliable."
  - Addition of unknowns: "I don't know Carol."
- Trust: Probability that agent is good.
- Reputation: Past behaviour. Can use to determine trust.
- Separation of privilege: Use multiple conditions to grant permissions.
- Architecture in Practice: Chrome
  - Least privilege, separation of privilege, defense in depth
  - Sandboxing, auto-update, malicious site warnings
  - Sandbox for untrusted web content; communicates with browser kernel only through IPC

## 9: Design introduction. (2017 Sep 28)

- Design process: Measure → Learn → Build → Measure ...
- Promote:
  - Abstraction
  - Flexibility
  - Modularity
  - Elegance
- STUPID principles:
  - Singleton
  - Tight coupling
  - Untestable
  - Premature optimization
  - Indescriptive naming
  - Duplication
- SOLID principles:
  - Single responsibility: Stuff does one thing
  - Open/closed: Stuff can be extended but not changed
  - Liskov substitution: Subtypes have at least as many guarantees, at most as many requirements as their parents
  - Interface segregation: Interfaces should have only key methods
  - Dependency inversion: High-level methods should NOT depend on low-level modules
- Lower level principles (SPEC)
  - Strive for loose coupling
  - Program to abstractions, not implementations
  - Encapsulate what varies
  - Composition over inheritance
- Quality attributes
  - Simplicity: Tony Hoare "Obviously no deficiencies vs. no obvious deficiencies"
    - DRY
    - KISS

- Degrees of coupling:
  - [Content coupling]: [Directly refer to internal structures of another module]
  - [Global coupling]: [Shared globals]
  - [Control coupling]: [Change control flow of another class]
  - [Data coupling]: [Share data through parameters]
  - [Message coupling]: [Message passing]
  - None

- Types of cohesion:
  - [Coincidental]: [Random utilities].
  - [Logical]: [Seemingly similar]
  - [Temporal]: [Related in time]
  - [Communication]: [Same input/output data]
  - [Sequential]: [Input piped sequentially]
  - [Functional]: [For specifically one task]

- Incoherency: "X THEN DO Y THEN DO ...", many "IF THEN ELSE"s
- Cognitive dimensions:
  - Premature commitment: Decision made badly
  - Hidden dependencies: Weird temporal dependencies
  - Secondary notation: Non-obvious relationships
  - Viscosity: Resistance to change

## 10 - Creational design patterns (2017 Oct 5)

- Advantages of design patterns
  - Shared **vocabulary**
  - **Leverage** existing design knowledge
  - More **flexibility**
  - More **reusability**
- Class patterns:
  - **Factory Method**
    - Creator: Abstract class with abstract FactoryMethod().
    - ConcreteCreator -|> Creator: Implements FactoryMethod() that returns ConcreteProduct.
    - ConcreteProduct -|> Product.
- Object patterns:
  - **Abstract Factory**
    - Abstract class with several concrete factories.
    - AbstractFactory: Abstract class with CreateProductA and CreateProductB.
    - ConcreteFactory1, ConcreteFactory2 -|> AbstractFactory.
    - ConcreteFactory1 produces ProductA1 and ProductB1.
    - ConcreteFactory2 produces ProductA2 and ProductB2.
    - Client only knows about AbstractFactory, AbstractProductA, AbstractProductB.
  - **Builder**
    - Takes parts and builds an object
    - Result can be obtained from builder by .build() method
    - Poor OO programmer's half-replacement for constructor kwargs
  - **Prototype**
    - Concrete prototypes and cloning
  - **Singleton**
    - You can only have one instance of a class (weirdly enough, as a static member OF the class)
    - You can get it from anywhere
    - Basically lipstick on top of a global

## 11 - Structural design patterns (2017 Oct 12)

- Composition/Aggregation:
  - Composition (black diamond): The composed cannot exist independently of the composer.
  - Aggregation (white diamond): The aggregator simply contains references to some aggregates.
- Class patterns:
  - **Class adapter**
    - Adaptor class multiple-inherits from N adaptees, providing access to their methods through a common method. Absolutely disgusting.
- Object patterns:
  - **Object adapter**
    - Adaptor class contains an Adaptee, providing a different interface to access it. Not as yucky as class adapter.
  - **Bridge**
    - Decouples abstraction from its implementation
    - RefinedAbstraction -|> Abstraction (aggregates an Implementor)
    - ConcreteImplementor -|> Implementor (abstract)
  - **Composite**
    - Tree.
  - **Decorator**
    - Decorator contains a Component and is also a Component itself
    - ConcreteComponent, ConcreteDecorator both implement operation()
  - Facade
    - Provides simplified interface to multiple libraries
  - Flyweight
    - Flyweights share expensive internal structure
    - Kinda like hash consing
  - Proxy
    - Wrapper around expensive-to-instantiate objects.
    - Proxy refers to a RealSubject.
    - Proxy inherit's the RealSubject's interface. Client MAY interact with Proxy instead of RealSubject, but they dgaf since they're both Subjects.

## 12: Behavioral design patterns (2017 Oct 17)

- Behavioral patterns: Model often-used communication techniques.
- Challenge 2: File system with files and directories.
  - Soln: Composite
- Challenge 2b: 2, w/ ls, du, -f X
  - Use... a visitor! LOL!
- Class patterns:
  - **Interpreter**: For a domain specific language
  - **Template method**: Subclass only has to implement certain primitive operations
- Object patterns:
  - **Chain of Responsibility**
    - Decorate level over level.
  - **Command**
  - **Iterator**
  - **Mediator**
    - Abstracts away interactions between multiple different objects
    - Unlike Facade, simplifies communication between the classes
      - Both Facade and Mediator reduce kyappuringu
  - **Memento**
    - Remember internal state without messing with it
  - **Observer**
    - Observers have a notify() method
    - Subject can be registered, deregistered with Observers
    - Used in MVC
  - **State**
  - **Strategy**
  - **Visitor**
    - Aids open/closed principle
    - Client has a ConcreteVisitor -|> Visitor, can visit ConcreteElements
    - Client has a ConcreteElement -|> Element, accepts a Visitor
    - Single dispatch: Traditional dynamic dispatch.
    - Double dispatch: Both element and visitors are dynamically dispatched.
- MVX
  - MVC: MV Controller
  - MVP: MV Presenter
  - MVVM: MV ViewModel

## 13: Refactoring, code smells, MVC (2017 Oct 19)

- Builder pattern from Wikipedia
  - Breaks down complicated constructors
  - Problem with Wikipedia example: Builder instance returns the same car every build()
  - Scala one actually works lol
- Refactoring:
  - Restructure code without changing its external behavior
- Code smells:  
  - Large class, large method
  - Deeply nested control
  - Duplicate code
  - Static state: a `public static`... is just a fkn global!
  - No information hiding, bad encapsulation
  - Many parameters
  - Casts to implementation classes
- MVC
  - Started with Smalltalk-80
  - Java UI frameworks, EJB (Enterprise Java Beans), GWT, .NET
  - Motivation:
    - UI changes more frequently than business logic
    - Same data displayed many ways
    - Designers generally != developers
    - Hard to test UI code
  - Model: Just data
  - View: Presents model
  - Controller: "Glues Model and View together" -- not actually true, but whatever
  - View is often tightly coupled w/ Controller, because buttons are part of the UI
  - Topology (better way to think about it):
    - user CALLS controller UPDATES model NOTIFIES view IS DISPLAYED TO user
  - View, Controller often use Strategy (shitty replacement for lambdas)
  - View often uses Composite, since UI components are a tree (this makes sense)
  - View, Model often interact through Observer
- Design exercise: Calculator with +-×÷
- Midterm: Architectural styles, design patterns, UML, reading code
- Midterm ends here

## 15: Dependency injection (2017 Oct 31)

- Recall SOLID
- Dependency injection
  - Program to INTERFACES, not IMPLEMENTATIONS.
  - e.g. For passing mock objects into tests
  - Goals:
    - Take set of components (classes and interfaces)
    - Add a set of configuration metadata
    - Provide metadata to an injection framework
    - Bootstrap object creation with a configured injector
  - e.g. Google Guice bind(blah.class).to(actualblah.class);
- Terms
  - Inversion of control: The high should not depend on the low.
    - Patterns: Factory, Service Locator, Dependency, Template Method, Strategy.
  - Dependency injection: see above
  - Dependency inversion principle:
- Python: kwargs in constructor
- Perl: can also kwargs, or library that context maps string names to services

## 16: Cloud/web services (2017 Nov 2)

- Today: Cloud computing. Think AWS, DigitalOcean, Google Cloud, Vultr.
- NIST essential characteristics
  - On-demand self service.
  - Broad network access.
  - Resource pooling.
- Benefits:
  - Agility
  - Scalability
  - Cost
  - Reliability
  - Security
- Disadvantages:
  - No custom hardware
- Virtualization: Decouple physical and computing resources.
  - Emulation (QEMU): VM simulates partial HW.
  - Paravirtualization (Xen) Software intf to VM
  - Full (VMware) complete simulation of HW
  - Network (abstract network, e.g. VPNs)

## 17: Microservices (2017 Nov 7)

- Cloud precursors:
  - Grid computing: Big fats
  - Utility computing: Metering compute like utilities 
- Cloud computing: Big fats metering compute like utilities
- NIST Essential Characteristics:
  - On-demand self-service: No human interaction
  - Broad network access: Standard network access
  - Resource pooling: Resources are pooled
  - Location independence: Doesn't really matter where the servers are
  - Rapid elasticity: Can easily add/remove resources
  - Measured service: Amazon gets paid
- Benefits of Cloud
  - Agility: Quickly respond to change
  - Scalability: Can add resources
  - Cost: Can buy cheap resources
  - Reliability: You get Amazon data centre engineers
  - Security: "Works both ways"
- SaaS: Software as a service. Like Google Docs.
- PaaS: Platform as a service. Like App Engine.
- Cloud security NFPs:
  - Confidentiality
  - Integrity
  - Authenticity
  - Anonymity
  - Privacy
- REST: Representational state transfer
  - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- Web frameworks are things
- WSDL, SOAP are things that you should learn. TODO
- Erlang Solutions

## 18: Static analysis (2017 Nov 9)

- Plug: CheckerFramework.org
- Bugs cause lots of money and lives

- Java has a really shitty type system:
  - System.console().readLine(); -- [console may return null]
  - Collections.emptyList().add("one"); -- [emptyList returns an immutable]

- Pluggable type checking is cool
- Optional type checking is cool; really good since you can have multiple

## 19: Static analysis (2017 Nov 14)

- look at my shitty Option types!!! `@Nullable @NonNull` AYYY lmAO
- was working on postlab clearly
- Read the bug finding tools paper (Coverity)

- [Gradual] type systems:
  - TypeScript
  - Flow
  - Python 3

- Newer programming languages:
  - Scala
  - Kotlin
  - F#

- Concurrency programming languages:
  - Erlang
  - Go
  - Pony: actor-based like erlang
  - Rust:
    - ultra-safe type system with ownership
    - no forced design pattern
    - called rust because close to bare metal

## 20: Programming languages and actors

- [Defining a type system]:
  - 1. [Qualifier hierarchy]
    - Define subtyping
  - 2. [Type introduction rules]
    - Types for expressions
  - 3. [Type rules]
    - Checker specific errors
  - 4. [Flow refinement]
    - Find better types than the ones the programmer wrote

- Dataflow framework:
  - Just do graphy things
  - Control flow graph is a thing!
  - Checker framework has CFG display flag

- Tips for introducting static analysis:
  - Start with a little bit of code
  - Only check properties you care about
  - Subclass, not type qualify, if possible (W,T,FUCK)
  - Write spec first
  - Avoid suppression
  - Avoid Java raw types (unparameterized generics???)

- Other options for analysis:
  - Findbugs, PMD, Valgrind, KLEE
  - Daikon, Synoptic
  - Clafer, Checker Framework
  - OpenJML, Eiffel, Spec#, CodeContracts
  - Z3, Isabelle, Coq
  - BLAST, SPIN, Java Pathfinder, TLA+
