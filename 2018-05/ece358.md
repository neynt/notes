# ECE 358: Computer Networks

Professor: Albert Wasef

## Chapter 1: Introduction

<!-- 2018 May 02 -->

- The internet consists of:
  - Hosts (end systems), running network apps
  - Communication links (fiber, copper, radio, satellite)
  - Packet switches (routers and switches)

- Protocols control the sending and receiving of messages
  - Define format, order of messages, actions taken
- Internet standards include:
  - RFC: Request for comments
  - IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force

- Network structure:
  - Edge: Hosts (clients and servers)
  - Access networks, physical media: Communication links
  - Network core: Interconnected routers. The "network of networks".

- Types of access nets:
  - DSL
  - Cable

- DSL: Digital subscriber line.
  - Using existing telephone lines to connect to the internet.
  - A DSLAM (DSL Access Multiplexer) is installed at the edge of the telephone
    network
  - A splitter at the home decides between a DSL modem and a telephone
  - Transmission rates: 2.5 Mbps upstream, 24 Mbps downstream
    - This asymmetry is mainly economics (customers usually want faster
      downstream, so more bandwidth is allocated)

- Cable network
  - Uses *frequency division multiplexing* -- different channels are
    transmitted in different frequency bands.
  - HFC: Hybrid fiber coax

(part 2)

- Wireless access networks
  - Wireless LAN: within building. 802.11b/g (wifi) is 54 Mbps
  - Wide-area wireless: covers a larger area. 3G, 4G are LTE

- How transmission happens
  - Host sends packets of length L (bits)
  - Transmits packet into access network at transmission rate R (bits/sec)
  - Packet transmission delay = L / R (sec)
  - Time to transmit one bit = 1 / R (sec / bit)

- Physical media
  - Guided vs. unguided
    - Guided media: Solid, like copper, fiber, or coaxial cable.
    - Unguided media: Radio waves.
  - Twisted pair: Two insulated copper wires that are twisted around each other
    to minimize interference.
    - Cat5: 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps (typically blue)
    - Cat6: 10 Gbps (typically yellow)
    - Can only provide a single channel due to the material that's used.
  - Coaxial cable
    - Two concentric copper conductors
    - Broadband
  - Fiber optic cable
    - Glass fiber carrying light
    - Secure (can't tap into it) (?)
    - Low error rate
  - Radio
    - Propagation is affected by environment
      - Reflection
      - Obstruction
      - Interference
    - Needs line of sight.
    - Types:
      - Terrestrial microwave: up to 45 Mbps
      - LAN/wifi: 11 Mbps, 54 Mbps
      - Wide-area (e.g. cellular): a few Mbps
      - Satellite: Kbps to 45 Mbps
        - 280 ms end-to-end delay

- The network core
  - Packet switching
    - "Store and forward": The entire packet must arrive before it can be
      transmitted to the next link.
      - This implies that each link introduces an additional packet
        transmission delay.
    - Routing and forwarding
      - [Routing] is determining the route that should be taken by packets
      - [Forwarding] is actually forwarding the packets
  - Circuit switching
    - You actually get a physical circuit to the other machine
    - Like traditional telephone networks
    - FDM: Frequency Division Multiplexing
    - TDM: Time Division Multiplexing

- How are access net interconnected?
  - Connect every access net to every other access net. O(nÂ²), doesn't
    web-scale
  - In reality:
    - Tier-1 ISPs are connected via IXPs (Internet Exchange Points) and peering
      links
    - Regional nets group together Tier-1 ISPs (e.g. Rogers, Bell)
    - Also companies create their own CDNs that connect directly to access nets
    - So really the internet is a poset

- Loss and delay
  - If the arrival rate exceeds the output link capacity, then packets will
    queue up and this introduces a delay, which means no arbitrage for you
    tonight.
  - Four sources of packet delay: 
    - `d_nodal = d_proc + d_queue + d_trans + d_prop`
    - `d_proc`: Processing delay (software or ASICs on the node); usu. < 1ms
    - `d_queue`: Queueing delay
    - `d_trans`: Transmission delay. `L/R` where L: packet length; R: link
      bandwidth
    - `d_prop`: Propagation delay. `d/s` where d: length of wire, s:
      propagation speed (~(2/3)c)
  - Queueing delay:
    - let R = link bandwith
    - and L = packet length
    - and a = average packet arrival rate in
    - The queueing delay increases as La/R goes from 0 to 1, then becomes
      unbounded.
  - In reality, packets are dropped when the queue is full.

- In traceroute, `* * *` indicates that a router isn't replying. (It might
  still be working, but ignoring you.)

- Throughput
  - Rate at which user receives useful data.
  - Instantaneous vs. Average.
  - Example: Consider two pipes with throughputs Rs and Rc. Then end-to-end
    throughput is min(Rs, Rc). The slower pipe is the **bottleneck link**.
  - If n users are using a pipe, then it has effective throughput R/n.

- OSI model: Layered model of internet.
  - Physical
  - Link
  - Network
  - Transport
  - (Session)
  - (Presentation)
  - Application
  - Layers in parens are fake, part of OSI model which was invented when people
    had no idea what they were doing

- Encapsulation / Decapsulation
  - It's when you have nested boxes, unwrap some, and rebox in others
  -       M: message
  -     HtM: segment
  -   HnHtM: datagram
  - HlHnHtM: frame

- The source and destination encapsulate all five layers
- A switch implements only Physical and Link
- A router implements only Physical, Link, and Network

- Network security
  - Internet was not originally designed with security in mind.
  - Cat-and-mouse game between hackers and internet designers.

- Malware
  - Virus: Executed self-replication infection
  - Worm: Passively received self-replication infection
  - Spyware Malware: Record and upload input
  - Infected hosts can be part of a botnet

## Chapter 2: Application Layer

<!-- 2018 May 7 -->

- When you write a network app, you only have to write the application layer.

- Application architectures:
  - client/server
  - peer to peer

- Socket
  - Like a pipe implemented at the transport layer and under

- Application layer protocols
  - Defines:
    - Types of messages
    - Message syntax
    - Message semantics
    - Rules for sending messages
  - Can be open or proprietary

- Transport service requirements
  - Data integrity
  - Throughput
  - Timing
  - Security

- Look at those four things for common apps (EXAM, previous midterm)

- Securing TCP: use SSL at the application layer

<!-- 2018 May 11 -->

- An RTT is a RoundTrip Time

- HTTP persistence
  - Non-persistent: Each TCP connection is closed after one request.
  - Persistent: Multiple objects sent over a single TCP connection.

- HTTP Delay Estimation interactive is incorrect with pipelining?

- HTTP request format:
  - Request line
    - method sp URL sp version CRLF
  - Header lines
    - header-field-name sp value CRLF
    - CRLF
  - Body
    - entity body

- Uploading form input:
  - POST: input uploaded to server in entity body
  - GET: input encoded at end of URL

- HTTP methods:
  - HTTP/1.0: GET, POST, HEAD (don't include body)
  - HTTP/1.1: GET, POST, HEAD, PUT (upload file), DELETE (delete file)

- HTTP headers:
  - Date: Time of sending the response.
  - Last-Modified: Mtime
  - Content-Length: in bytes

- Cookies:
  - Four components:
    - Cookie header line of response
    - Cookie header line in subsequent requests
    - Cookie file kept browser-side
    - Database kept website-side

- Web caching
  - Cache acts as both client and server
  - Example: 97.4% utilization; 4.5 sec total delay
    - 100x access link rate makes it 0.974% utilization; 2 sec total delay
    - Local web cache with 0.4 hit rate: 1.29 total delay

<!-- 2018 May 14 -->

- DNS
  - Domain name system.
  - A hierarchy of **name servers**, forming a **distributed database**.
  - Provides services:
    - Hostname to IP resolution
    - Host aliasing
    - Mail server aliasing
    - Load distribution (one name, many IPs)
  - **Root name servers** are contacted if a local name server cannot resolve.
    - They contact the **authoritative name server** for that name.
  - TLD (Top-level domain) servers: For TLDs.
    - Network Solutions maintains the .com TLD server.
    - Educause does .edu.
  - Authoritative name server: Organization's own DNS servers.
  - Local name server: "default name server". Has cache.
  - Resolution example
    - Iterated query: "I don't know this, but ask this server"
    - Recursive query: "I don't know this, but I'll get this for you"
      - Heavy load at higher levels
    - Typically, flow is:
      - Requesting host
      - Local DNS server
      - Root DNS server
      - TLD DNS server
      - Authoritative DNS server
  - Caching
    - TTL: Time to live
    - Can be out of date
    - RFC 2136: Update/notify mechanism proposed by IETF
  - RR: Resource records
    - (name, value, type, ttl)
    - Types:
      - A: Authoritative. name is hostname, value is IP address
      - CNAME: Canonical name. name is alias name, value is canonical name
      - NS: Nameserver. name is domain, value is authoritative name server
      - MX: Mailserver. name is domain, value is mailserver
  - DNS protocol
    - identification; flags
    - # questions; # answer RRs; # authority RRs; # additional RRs
    - Questions;   Answers;      Authority;       Additional info
  - Attacking DNS
    - DDoS on DNS:
      - Bombard root server with traffic.
        - Not successful so far due to traffic filtering, root server bypass
      - Bombard TLD servers: "Potentially more dangerous."
    - Redirect attacks:
      - Man in the middle
      - DNS poisoning (bogus replies which are cached)
    - Exploit DNS for DDoS:
      - Send queries with spoofed source address -> target ip
      - Requires leverage

## Chapter 3

- Transport layers and protocols
  - Transport layer: Layer below the application
  - Provides logical end-to-end transport as a service to the application
  - Vs. network layer
    - Network layer is between hosts.
    - Transport layer is between processes. A host can have multiple processes.
  - Multiplexing and demultiplexing
    - at sender: multiplexing to combine multiple sockets into one stream
    - at receiver: demultiplexing to split it apart again
  - TODO: Review types of demuxing

<!-- 2018 May 18 -->

- UDP: User datagram protocol (RFC 768)
  - No frills. Fast, but segments may be lost, out of order
  - Connectionless
  - Used for streaming, DNS, SNMP
  - If you want reliability, must add it at the application layer

- UDP checksum
  - It's a wrapping sum of the rest of the segment chunked into 16-bit chunks

- Reliable data transfer
  - We want functions:
    - Sender: `rdt_send` which calls `udt_send`
    - Receiver: `rdt_rcv`, which calls `deliver_data`
  - Use FSMs on both sender and receiver side
  - rdt1.0: assume reliable channel, then it's very simple
  - rdt2.0: "stop and wait". must recover from errors
    - ACK: acknowledgement
    - NAK: negative acknowledgement; got packet but it had errors
    - On an exam, you may explain the RDT FSM with code or with text
    - Fatal flaw: ACK/NAK corrupted
  - rdt2.1: handle lost ACKs and NAKs
    - add sequence number to packets; receiver discards duplicates; sender
      retransmits packets where ACKs aren't received
      - for now, just have sequence numbers 0 and 1 for parity
  - rdt2.2: NAK-free
    - receiver sends ACK tagged with seq num of last packet received
  - rdt3.0: channels can lose packets too
    - sender waits a reasonable time for ACK, retransmits if no ACK in that
      time
    - but performance is bad because of stop-and-wait behavior
    - use pipelining

- Pipelined protocols
  - Go-back-N
    - Sender has up to N unacked packets in pipeline
    - Receiver only sends cumulative ack (seq num such that all packets up to
      that seq num have been received)
    - Sender has timer for oldest unacked packet; when expired, retransmit all
      unacked packets
    - Used by TCP
  - Selective repeat
    - Sender has up to N unacked packets in pipeline
    - Receiver sends individual ack for each packet
    - Separate timer for each unacked packet; when expired, retransmit only
      that one
    - Needs at least twice as many sequence numbers as the window size

<!-- 2018 May 25 -->

- TCP
  - Connection-oriented, point-to-point, reliable, in-order byte stream, full
    duplex data, pipelined, flow controlled

- TCP Structure
  - source port; dest port
  - seq num
  - ack num
  - head len; not used; UAPRSF; RWD (receive window: # bytes receiver willing
    to receive)
    - URG: urgent data (not used)
    - ACK: ack # valid
    - PSH: push data now (not used)
    - RST, SYN, FIN: connection setup, synchronize, teardown
  - checksum; urgent data pointer
  - options (var len)
  - application data (var len)

- TCP reliability
  - SampleRTT: Samples the round trip time, for setting TCP timeout value
    - EstimatedRTT: Uses an EWMA, alpha = 0.125
    - DevRTT: Deviation
    - TimeoutInterval = EstimatedRTT + 4 * DevRTT (FOUR SIGMA)

  - Reliability via sequence numbers, cumulative ACKs

  - Three events in sender:
    - Received data from app: create segment, start timer if not already
      running
    - Timeout: retransmit segment that caused timeout, reset timer
    - Received ACK: update what is known, start timer if still unacked segments

  - Fast retransmit:
    - with TRIPLE DUPLICATE ACKs, resend earliest unacked segment without
      waiting for timeout

- TCP flow control
  - Receiver prevents sender from transmitting too quickly
  - ... by advertising free buffer spacing with the RWND value

- TCP connection management
  - Handshake before any data is exchanged
  - Agree on connection parameters
  - 2-way handshake:
    - "Let's talk" "OK"
    - Won't always work. Variable delays, retransmitted messages, message
      reordering
    - Review the failure scenarios
      - Half-open connection with a retransmit
      - With additional retransmits, can get even worse
  - Instead: 3-way handshake
    - (->) SYN=1, Seq=x; x is random
    - (<-) SYN=1, ACK=1, Seq=y, ACK=x+1; y is random.
    - Client ESTAB'd
    - (->) ACK=1, ACK=y+1; 
    - Server ESTAB'd
  - Closing a connection
    - Both client and server send FIN=1
    - Respond to FIN with ACK (can combine into FINACK)

<!-- 2018 May 28 --> <!-- Missed class due to fatness -->

- Congestion control
  - Don't want to send too much data for the network to handle
  - Results in lost packets, long delays
  - Three scenarios:
    - 1: Two senders, two receivers, one infinite buffer router
      - Large queueing delay as Î»in -> Î»out
    - 2: One router, finite buffers, sender retransmits
      - Duplicate retransmits
      - Asymptotic goodput is less than R/2
    - 3: 4 senders, multihop paths, timeout/retransmit
      - More routers = more wasted network effort
      - Dropped packets = entire upstream path wasted
  - Approaches
    - End-to-end congestion control
      - No feedback from network
      - Inferred from end-system observed loss, delay
      - e.g. TCP
    - Network-assisted congestion control
      - Routers provide feedback to end systems
      - Congestion bit (e.g. SNA, DECbit, TCP/IP ECN, ATM)
      - Explicit rate for senders

- TCP congestion control
  - Sender increases transmission rate until loss occurs
  - Additive increase: increase cwnd by 1 MSS until loss detected
  - Multiplicative decrease: cut cwnd in half after loss
  - Results in sawtooth behavior
  - rwnd is usually large
  - TCP Slow Start
    - Initially cwnd = 1 MSS
    - Double rate until first loss, to ramp up
  - TCP Tahoe: Always set cwnd to 1 after a loss, exponential until ssthresh,
    then linear
  - TCP Reno: Just reset to ssthresh (halved)

- TCP throughput
  - 3/4 W / RTT bytes / sec because sawtooth between W/2 and W

- TCP futures

- TCP fairness
  - If K TCP sessions share a bottleneck link of capacity R, each should have
    average rate K/R
  - TCP is fair
  - Multimedia: shouldn't use TCP, since you want audio/video to be sent at
    constant rate; must tolerate packet loss

## 4: Network layer

### 4.1. Introduction

- Network layer
  - Host-to-host

- Key network-layer functions:
  - Forwarding
  - Routing
  - Sometimes: Connection setup
    - ATM, frame relay, X.25
    - Routers are involved in establishing connection between end hosts
    - Connects to hosts, as opposed to transport-layer which connects two
      processes

- Network service model
  - Service model: Best effort, CBR, VBR, ABR, or UBR
  - Guarantees
    - Bandwidth: None, constant rate, guaranteed rate, guaranteed minimum
    - Loss: y/n
    - Order: y/n
    - Timing: y/n
  - Congestion feedback: y/n
  - Internet is: best effort, none, no, no, no

### 4.2. Virtual circuit vs. datagram networks

- Connection vs. connectionless service
  - Datagram networks: connectionless
  - Virtual-circuit networks: connection
  - Like TCP/UDP dichotomy connection/connectionless, but:
    - The service is host-to-host instead of process-to-process
    - You have no choice: you have to have one or the other
    - Implementation is in network core instead of transport layer

- Virtual circuits
  - Much like a physical telephone circuit, but virtual
  - Routers must maintain state for each connection
  - Each packet carries VC identifier, not destination host address

- VC forwarding tables
  - Complicated.
  - Tables contain:
    - Incoming interface, incoming VC #
    - Outgoing interface, outgoing VC #

- Signaling protocols
  - For setting up, maintaining, and tearing down virtual circuits
  - Used in ATM, frame-relay, X.25
  - Not used in today's internet.
  - e.g.
    - 1. initiate call
    - 2. incoming call, 3. accept call
    - 4. call connected, 5. data flow begins
    - 6. receive data
    - ... all in the Network layer!

- Datagram networks
  - Just have a forwarding table from destination address to link interfaces
  - Can't map every single IP. Instead, map IP ranges
  - For efficiency, use longest prefix matching

### 4.3. Inside a router

- Two key router functions:
  - Run routing algorithms
  - Forward datagrams from input to output links

- Input port:
  - Physical layer: Line termination
  - Link layer: Receive
  - Network layer: Lookup, forwarding, queueing.

- Switching fabric
  - Memory
    - Like a traditional computer.
    - Packed copied to memory, mutated by CPU, sent out through system bus.
  - Bus
    - Datagram goes straight from input port memory to output port memory.
    - Can have bus contention, where switching speed is limited by bus
      bandwidth.
  - Interconnection network
    - e.g. Banyan network, crossbar
    - Overcomes bus bandwidth limitations
    - e.g. Cisco 12000 can do 60 Gbps

- Output ports:
  - Network layer: Buffering
  - Link layer: Send
  - Physical layer: Line termination

- Output port buffering
  - RFC 3439: Average buffering = RTT * C
  - With N flows, buffering = RTT * C / sqrt(N)

- HOL blocking: Queued datagram at front of queue prevents others from moving
  forward, even if their output ports are free

<!-- 2018 Jun 8 -->

### 4.4. Internet protocol

- IP datagram format (32 bits per line):
  - ver; header len; type of service; length
  - 16-bit id; flags (incl. fragflag); fragment offset
  - ttl; upper layer; header checksum
  - source IP addr
  - dest IP addr
  - options... (optional)
  - data... (typically a TCP or UDP segment)

- Fragmentation, reassembly
  - MTU: Max transfer size
  - Large datagrams can be fragmented (divided into smaller ones)
  - They are reassembled at the final destination
  - Header bits are used to identify and order related fragments
    - Length is chopped up
    - ID stays the same
    - fragflag is 0 for last fragment, 1 for all others
    - offset is increased

- IP addressing
  - An IP address is associated with each interface, not each device! So
    routers can have multiple IPs
  - Subnet: Devices in the same subnet can physically reach each other without
    additional routers
  - CIDR: Classless interdomain routing
    - a.b.c.d/x: x is # of bits in subnet
  - Getting one:
    - Can be hard-coded
    - Can use DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

- DHCP
  - Four messages:  
    - Host broadcasts "DHCP discover" (optional)
    - DHCP server responds with "DHCP offer" (optional)
    - Host requests IP address with "DHCP request"
    - DHCP server sends address with "DHCP ack"
  - Can also return:
    - Address of first-hop router
    - Name and address of DNS server
    - Network mask
  - Layers so far: Phy; Eth; IP; UDP; DHCP

- ICANN: Internet corporation for assigned names and numbers
  - Allocates IP addresses to ISPs
  - Manages DNS
  - Resolves disputes

- NAT: Network address translation
  - Local network uses just one IP address facing the outside world
  - Controversial
    - Routers should only process up to layer 3
    - Violates end-to-end; P2P apps must take NAT into account
    - Should instead solve address shortage by IPv6
  - Incoming connections require one of:
    - Static port forwarding
    - UPnP IGD
    - Relaying (both NATted clients connect to relay)

- ICMP: Internet control message protocol
  - Error reporting, pings
  - Message consists of:
    - type
    - code + first 8 bytes of IP datagram causing error
  - Traceroute
    - Source sends series of UDP segments with TTL=1, 2, ...

- IPv6
  - Motivation: Need more addresses, better header format with no fragmentation
  - Datagram format:
    - ver; priority; flow label (concept of flow not well defined)
    - payload len; nex header; hop limit
    - source address
    - destination address
    - data...
  - Checksum removed
  - Options are outside of header, indicated by "next header" field
  - Brings with it ICMPv6
  - Tunneling: IPv6 datagram carried as payload in IPv4 datagram for
    compatibility

<!-- 2018 Jun 11 -->

### 4.5. Routing algorithms

- Graph abstraction
  - Can think of network as graph
  - Nodes are routers
  - Edges are links
  - Edges have costs
  - Goal: Find least-cost path betwen two nodes

- Routing algorithms
  - Some work with global information; others are decentralized
  - Some are static; others are dynamic (can update efficiently in response to
    changes)

- Link state algorithm
  - Link costs known to all nodes, via link state broadcast
  - e.g. Dijkstra's (priority-first search)
    - Each router is the root of a shortest-path tree, which determines its
      forwarding table
    - O(n log n)
    - Oscillations possible

- Distance vector algorithms
  - e.g. Bellman-Ford (try all intermediate nodes)
    - Bellman ford equation: if dx(y) = cost of least-cost path from x to y,
      then dx(y) = min over all v of c(x,v) + dv(y)
    - Dx(y) is esimate of dx(y)
  - Nodes send their own distance vector estimates to neighbors
  - Nodes receiving new distance estimates update their own distance estimates
  - Is iterative, asynchronous, distributed
  - When link cost changes, good news travels quickly but bad news travels slowly
  - Poisoned reverse: Nodes tell nodes that it forwards to not to go backward

- LS vs DV
  - Message complexity: LS sends O(nE) messages; DV exchanges messages between
    neighbors only
  - Speed of convergence: LS is O(n^2) algorithm requiring O(nE) messages and
    may have oscillations; DV has varying convergence time, permits routing
    loops, and may count to infinity
  - Robustness: LS nodes may advertise incorrect link costs; DV nodes may
    advertise incorrect path cost and errors propagate through the network

<!-- 2018 Jun 18 -->

- Exam will have more theoretical questions.
  - More TCP questions.
  - Longer exam, since we have more time.

- Hierarchical routing
  - LV and DV are both over-idealized, won't work at world scale
  - Have a hierarchy.
  - Autonomous System (AS): Region of routers
  - Routers in same AS run same routing protocol
  - Gateway router: At the edge of ASes, communicate with other ASes
  - Routers should know the gateways of their ASes

- Hot potato routing
  - Send packets to the closest of the two routers

- Intra-AS routing (aka interior gateway protocols)
  - RIP: Routing Information Protocol
    - 1982, BSD Unix
    - Uses Distance Vector algorithm
    - route-d: application that manages routing tables
  - OSPF: Open Shortest Path First
    - Publicly available algorithm
    - Advanced features:
      - Security (all messages authenticated)
      - Multiple paths
      - Multicast support
      - Can be hierarchical (with boundary routers, backbone routers)
  - IGRP: Interior Gateway Routing Protocol
    - Cisco proprietary

- Inter-AS routing
  - BGP: *the* de facto inter-domain routing protocol. The glue that holds the
    internet together.
  - eBGP: Subnet reachability from neighboring ASes
  - iBGP: Propagate reachability information to AS-internal routers
  - BGP session: When two BGP routers (peers) exchange BGP messages
    - Over semi-permanent TCP connections
    - iBGP within the same AS, eBGP between ASes
  - A "route" is a BGP prefix + BGP attributes
  - BGP attributes
    - AS-PATH: List of ASes through which prefix advertisemnt has passed
    - NEXT-HOP: The internal-AS router to use to get to the next-hop AS.
  - Import policy: Used by gateway routers to accept or decline routes
  - BGP route selection:
    - If a router knows more than one route to the destination AS, it selects a route based on
      - 1. Policy: Local preference value attribute
      - 2. Shortest AS-PATH
      - 3. Hot potato: Closest NEXT-HOP router
      - 4. Additional Criteria
  - BGP messages:
    - OPEN: Open TCP connection to peer, authenticate sender
    - UPDATE: Advertise new path, or withdraw old path
    - KEEPALIVE: Keeps connection alive and ACKs OPEN request
    - NOTIFICATION: Report errors in previous message; closes connection

- Putting it all together: How does an entry get into a router's forwarding
  table?
  - 1. Router becomes aware of prefix
    - From BGP routes in messages
  - 2. Router determines output port for prefix
  - 3. Router enters prefix-port in forwarding table

## 5. Link Layer

Taking notes per slide because I got rekt on the midterm and the prof seems to
like asking questions taken directly from the slides, as opposed to anything
like what was in the problem sets or past midterm.

- 1: -
- 2: -
- 3: -
- 4: The link layer is responsible for forming communication channels between
  adjacent nodes.
- 5: Transportation analogy
- 6,7: Link layer services:
  - Coordinates the sharing of a single network medium, with MAC addresses.
  - Reliable delivery
  - Flow control (pacing)
  - Error detection
  - Error correction
  - Half-duplex and full-duplex
- 8: Link layer is implemented in the Network Interface Card
- 9: Example of adaptors communicating
- 10: -
- 11: EDC: Field for Error Detection and Correction bits. Cannot be 100%
  reliable.
- 12: Parity checking
  - Single bit parity (can be even (xor=0) or odd(xor=1)).
  - Two-dimensional bit parity: xor the rows AND the columns, and send both
    results.
    - Bottom-right-most bit is always zero, since it involves xoring each bit
      twice.
- 13: CRC: Cyclic redundancy check.
  - CRC is r bits long
  - Put r+1 bit pattern G (the "generator") on both the sender and receiver
  - CRC is satisfied if D concat R is divisible by G.
- 14: To compute CRC for a message, set R to 0 and long-divide D concat R by G.
  Then, R is simply the remainder.
