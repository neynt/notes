# ECE 358: Computer Networks

Professor: Albert Wasef

## Chapter 1: Introduction

<!-- 2018 May 02 -->

- The internet consists of:
  - Hosts (end systems), running network apps
  - Communication links (fiber, copper, radio, satellite)
  - Packet switches (routers and switches)

- Protocols control the sending and receiving of messages
  - Define format, order of messages, actions taken
- Internet standards include:
  - RFC: Request for comments
  - IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force

- Network structure:
  - Edge: Hosts (clients and servers)
  - Access networks, physical media: Communication links
  - Network core: Interconnected routers. The "network of networks".

- Types of access nets:
  - DSL
  - Cable

- DSL: Digital subscriber line.
  - Using existing telephone lines to connect to the internet.
  - A DSLAM (DSL Access Multiplexer) is installed at the edge of the telephone
    network
  - A splitter at the home decides between a DSL modem and a telephone
  - Transmission rates: 2.5 Mbps upstream, 24 Mbps downstream
    - This asymmetry is mainly economics (customers usually want faster
      downstream, so more bandwidth is allocated)

- Cable network
  - Uses *frequency division multiplexing* -- different channels are
    transmitted in different frequency bands.
  - HFC: Hybrid fiber coax

(part 2)

- Wireless access networks
  - Wireless LAN: within building. 802.11b/g (wifi) is 54 Mbps
  - Wide-area wireless: covers a larger area. 3G, 4G are LTE

- How transmission happens
  - Host sends packets of length L (bits)
  - Transmits packet into access network at transmission rate R (bits/sec)
  - Packet transmission delay = L / R (sec)
  - Time to transmit one bit = 1 / R (sec / bit)

- Physical media
  - Guided vs. unguided
    - Guided media: Solid, like copper, fiber, or coaxial cable.
    - Unguided media: Radio waves.
  - Twisted pair: Two insulated copper wires that are twisted around each other
    to minimize interference.
    - Cat5: 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps (typically blue)
    - Cat6: 10 Gbps (typically yellow)
    - Can only provide a single channel due to the material that's used.
  - Coaxial cable
    - Two concentric copper conductors
    - Broadband
  - Fiber optic cable
    - Glass fiber carrying light
    - Secure (can't tap into it) (?)
    - Low error rate
  - Radio
    - Propagation is affected by environment
      - Reflection
      - Obstruction
      - Interference
    - Needs line of sight.
    - Types:
      - Terrestrial microwave: up to 45 Mbps
      - LAN/wifi: 11 Mbps, 54 Mbps
      - Wide-area (e.g. cellular): a few Mbps
      - Satellite: Kbps to 45 Mbps
        - 280 ms end-to-end delay

- The network core
  - Packet switching
    - "Store and forward": The entire packet must arrive before it can be
      transmitted to the next link.
      - This implies that each link introduces an additional packet
        transmission delay.
    - Routing and forwarding
      - [Routing] is determining the route that should be taken by packets
      - [Forwarding] is actually forwarding the packets
  - Circuit switching
    - You actually get a physical circuit to the other machine
    - Like traditional telephone networks
    - FDM: Frequency Division Multiplexing
    - TDM: Time Division Multiplexing

- How are access net interconnected?
  - Connect every access net to every other access net. O(n²), doesn't
    web-scale
  - In reality:
    - Tier-1 ISPs are connected via IXPs (Internet Exchange Points) and peering
      links
    - Regional nets group together Tier-1 ISPs (e.g. Rogers, Bell)
    - Also companies create their own CDNs that connect directly to access nets
    - So really the internet is a poset

- Loss and delay
  - If the arrival rate exceeds the output link capacity, then packets will
    queue up and this introduces a delay, which means no arbitrage for you
    tonight.
  - Four sources of packet delay: 
    - `d_nodal = d_proc + d_queue + d_trans + d_prop`
    - `d_proc`: Processing delay (software or ASICs on the node); usu. < 1ms
    - `d_queue`: Queueing delay
    - `d_trans`: Transmission delay. `L/R` where L: packet length; R: link
      bandwidth
    - `d_prop`: Propagation delay. `d/s` where d: length of wire, s:
      propagation speed (~(2/3)c)
  - Queueing delay:
    - let R = link bandwith
    - and L = packet length
    - and a = average packet arrival rate in
    - The queueing delay increases as La/R goes from 0 to 1, then becomes
      unbounded.
  - In reality, packets are dropped when the queue is full.

- In traceroute, `* * *` indicates that a router isn't replying. (It might
  still be working, but ignoring you.)

- Throughput
  - Rate at which user receives useful data.
  - Instantaneous vs. Average.
  - Example: Consider two pipes with throughputs Rs and Rc. Then end-to-end
    throughput is min(Rs, Rc). The slower pipe is the **bottleneck link**.
  - If n users are using a pipe, then it has effective throughput R/n.

- OSI model: Layered model of internet.
  - Physical
  - Link
  - Network
  - Transport
  - (Session)
  - (Presentation)
  - Application
  - Layers in parens are fake, part of OSI model which was invented when people
    had no idea what they were doing

- Encapsulation / Decapsulation
  - It's when you have nested boxes, unwrap some, and rebox in others
  -       M: message
  -     HtM: segment
  -   HnHtM: datagram
  - HlHnHtM: frame

- The source and destination encapsulate all five layers
- A switch implements only Physical and Link
- A router implements only Physical, Link, and Network

- Network security
  - Internet was not originally designed with security in mind.
  - Cat-and-mouse game between hackers and internet designers.

- Malware
  - Virus: Executed self-replication infection
  - Worm: Passively received self-replication infection
  - Spyware Malware: Record and upload input
  - Infected hosts can be part of a botnet

## Chapter 2: Application Layer

<!-- 2018 May 7 -->

- When you write a network app, you only have to write the application layer.

- Application architectures:
  - client/server
  - peer to peer

- Socket
  - Like a pipe implemented at the transport layer and under

- Application layer protocols
  - Defines:
    - Types of messages
    - Message syntax
    - Message semantics
    - Rules for sending messages
  - Can be open or proprietary

- Transport service requirements
  - Data integrity
  - Throughput
  - Timing
  - Security

- Look at those four things for common apps (EXAM, previous midterm)

- Securing TCP: use SSL at the application layer

<!-- 2018 May 11 -->

- An RTT is a RoundTrip Time

- HTTP persistence
  - Non-persistent: Each TCP connection is closed after one request.
  - Persistent: Multiple objects sent over a single TCP connection.

- HTTP Delay Estimation interactive is incorrect with pipelining?

- HTTP request format:
  - Request line
    - method sp URL sp version CRLF
  - Header lines
    - header-field-name sp value CRLF
    - CRLF
  - Body
    - entity body

- Uploading form input:
  - POST: input uploaded to server in entity body
  - GET: input encoded at end of URL

- HTTP methods:
  - HTTP/1.0: GET, POST, HEAD (don't include body)
  - HTTP/1.1: GET, POST, HEAD, PUT (upload file), DELETE (delete file)

- HTTP headers:
  - Date: Time of sending the response.
  - Last-Modified: Mtime
  - Content-Length: in bytes

- Cookies:
  - Four components:
    - Cookie header line of response
    - Cookie header line in subsequent requests
    - Cookie file kept browser-side
    - Database kept website-side

- Web caching
  - Cache acts as both client and server
  - Example: 97.4% utilization; 4.5 sec total delay
    - 100x access link rate makes it 0.974% utilization; 2 sec total delay
    - Local web cache with 0.4 hit rate: 1.29 total delay

<!-- 2018 May 14 -->

- DNS
  - Domain name system.
  - A hierarchy of **name servers**, forming a **distributed database**.
  - Provides services:
    - Hostname to IP resolution
    - Host aliasing
    - Mail server aliasing
    - Load distribution (one name, many IPs)
  - **Root name servers** are contacted if a local name server cannot resolve.
    - They contact the **authoritative name server** for that name.
  - TLD (Top-level domain) servers: For TLDs.
    - Network Solutions maintains the .com TLD server.
    - Educause does .edu.
  - Authoritative name server: Organization's own DNS servers.
  - Local name server: "default name server". Has cache.
  - Resolution example
    - Iterated query: "I don't know this, but ask this server"
    - Recursive query: "I don't know this, but I'll get this for you"
      - Heavy load at higher levels
    - Typically, flow is:
      - Requesting host
      - Local DNS server
      - Root DNS server
      - TLD DNS server
      - Authoritative DNS server
  - Caching
    - TTL: Time to live
    - Can be out of date
    - RFC 2136: Update/notify mechanism proposed by IETF
  - RR: Resource records
    - (name, value, type, ttl)
    - Types:
      - A: Authoritative. name is hostname, value is IP address
      - CNAME: Canonical name. name is alias name, value is canonical name
      - NS: Nameserver. name is domain, value is authoritative name server
      - MX: Mailserver. name is domain, value is mailserver
  - DNS protocol
    - identification; flags
    - # questions; # answer RRs; # authority RRs; # additional RRs
    - Questions;   Answers;      Authority;       Additional info
  - Attacking DNS
    - DDoS on DNS:
      - Bombard root server with traffic.
        - Not successful so far due to traffic filtering, root server bypass
      - Bombard TLD servers: "Potentially more dangerous."
    - Redirect attacks:
      - Man in the middle
      - DNS poisoning (bogus replies which are cached)
    - Exploit DNS for DDoS:
      - Send queries with spoofed source address -> target ip
      - Requires leverage

## Chapter 3

- Transport layers and protocols
  - Transport layer: Layer below the application
  - Provides logical end-to-end transport as a service to the application
  - Vs. network layer
    - Network layer is between hosts.
    - Transport layer is between processes. A host can have multiple processes.
  - Multiplexing and demultiplexing
    - at sender: multiplexing to combine multiple sockets into one stream
    - at receiver: demultiplexing to split it apart again
  - TODO: Review types of demuxing

<!-- 2018 May 18 -->

- UDP: User datagram protocol (RFC 768)
  - No frills. Fast, but segments may be lost, out of order
  - Connectionless
  - Used for streaming, DNS, SNMP
  - If you want reliability, must add it at the application layer

- UDP checksum
  - It's a wrapping sum of the rest of the segment chunked into 16-bit chunks

- Reliable data transfer
  - We want functions:
    - Sender: `rdt_send` which calls `udt_send`
    - Receiver: `rdt_rcv`, which calls `deliver_data`
  - Use FSMs on both sender and receiver side
  - rdt1.0: assume reliable channel, then it's very simple
  - rdt2.0: "stop and wait". must recover from errors
    - ACK: acknowledgement
    - NAK: negative acknowledgement; got packet but it had errors
    - On an exam, you may explain the RDT FSM with code or with text
    - Fatal flaw: ACK/NAK corrupted
  - rdt2.1: handle lost ACKs and NAKs
    - add sequence number to packets; receiver discards duplicates; sender
      retransmits packets where ACKs aren't received
      - for now, just have sequence numbers 0 and 1 for parity
  - rdt2.2: NAK-free
    - receiver sends ACK tagged with seq num of last packet received
  - rdt3.0: channels can lose packets too
    - sender waits a reasonable time for ACK, retransmits if no ACK in that
      time
    - but performance is bad because of stop-and-wait behavior
    - use pipelining

- Pipelined protocols
  - Go-back-N
    - Sender has up to N unacked packets in pipeline
    - Receiver only sends cumulative ack (seq num such that all packets up to
      that seq num have been received)
    - Sender has timer for oldest unacked packet; when expired, retransmit all
      unacked packets
    - Used by TCP
  - Selective repeat
    - Sender has up to N unacked packets in pipeline
    - Receiver sends individual ack for each packet
    - Separate timer for each unacked packet; when expired, retransmit only
      that one
    - Needs at least twice as many sequence numbers as the window size

<!-- 2018 May 25 -->

- TCP
  - Connection-oriented, point-to-point, reliable, in-order byte stream, full
    duplex data, pipelined, flow controlled

- TCP Structure
  - source port; dest port
  - seq num
  - ack num
  - head len; not used; UAPRSF; RWD (receive window: # bytes receiver willing
    to receive)
    - URG: urgent data (not used)
    - ACK: ack # valid
    - PSH: push data now (not used)
    - RST, SYN, FIN: connection setup, synchronize, teardown
  - checksum; urgent data pointer
  - options (var len)
  - application data (var len)

- TCP reliability
  - SampleRTT: Samples the round trip time, for setting TCP timeout value
    - EstimatedRTT: Uses an EWMA, alpha = 0.125
    - DevRTT: Deviation
    - TimeoutInterval = EstimatedRTT + 4 * DevRTT (FOUR SIGMA)

  - Reliability via sequence numbers, cumulative ACKs

  - Three events in sender:
    - Received data from app: create segment, start timer if not already
      running
    - Timeout: retransmit segment that caused timeout, reset timer
    - Received ACK: update what is known, start timer if still unacked segments

  - Fast retransmit:
    - with TRIPLE DUPLICATE ACKs, resend earliest unacked segment without
      waiting for timeout

- TCP flow control
  - Receiver prevents sender from transmitting too quickly
  - ... by advertising free buffer spacing with the RWND value

- TCP connection management
  - Handshake before any data is exchanged
  - Agree on connection parameters
  - 2-way handshake:
    - "Let's talk" "OK"
    - Won't always work. Variable delays, retransmitted messages, message
      reordering
    - Review the failure scenarios
      - Half-open connection with a retransmit
      - With additional retransmits, can get even worse
  - Instead: 3-way handshake
    - (->) SYN=1, Seq=x; x is random
    - (<-) SYN=1, ACK=1, Seq=y, ACK=x+1; y is random.
    - Client ESTAB'd
    - (->) ACK=1, ACK=y+1; 
    - Server ESTAB'd
  - Closing a connection
    - Both client and server send FIN=1
    - Respond to FIN with ACK (can combine into FINACK)

<!-- 2018 May 28 --> <!-- Missed class due to fatness -->

- Congestion control
  - Don't want to send too much data for the network to handle
  - Results in lost packets, long delays
  - Three scenarios:
    - 1: Two senders, two receivers, one infinite buffer router
      - Large queueing delay as λin -> λout
    - 2: One router, finite buffers, sender retransmits
      - Duplicate retransmits
      - Asymptotic goodput is less than R/2
    - 3: 4 senders, multihop paths, timeout/retransmit
      - More routers = more wasted network effort
      - Dropped packets = entire upstream path wasted
  - Approaches
    - End-to-end congestion control
      - No feedback from network
      - Inferred from end-system observed loss, delay
      - e.g. TCP
    - Network-assisted congestion control
      - Routers provide feedback to end systems
      - Congestion bit (e.g. SNA, DECbit, TCP/IP ECN, ATM)
      - Explicit rate for senders

- TCP congestion control
  - Sender increases transmission rate until loss occurs
  - Additive increase: increase cwnd by 1 MSS until loss detected
  - Multiplicative decrease: cut cwnd in half after loss
  - Results in sawtooth behavior
  - rwnd is usually large
  - TCP Slow Start
    - Initially cwnd = 1 MSS
    - Double rate until first loss, to ramp up
  - TCP Tahoe: Always set cwnd to 1 after a loss, exponential until ssthresh,
    then linear
  - TCP Reno: Just reset to ssthresh (halved)

- TCP throughput
  - 3/4 W / RTT bytes / sec because sawtooth between W/2 and W

- TCP futures

- TCP fairness
  - If K TCP sessions share a bottleneck link of capacity R, each should have
    average rate K/R
  - TCP is fair
  - Multimedia: shouldn't use TCP, since you want audio/video to be sent at
    constant rate; must tolerate packet loss

## 4: Network layer

### 4.1. Introduction

- Network layer
  - Host-to-host

- Key network-layer functions:
  - Forwarding
  - Routing
  - Sometimes: Connection setup
    - ATM, frame relay, X.25
    - Routers are involved in establishing connection between end hosts
    - Connects to hosts, as opposed to transport-layer which connects two
      processes

- Network service model
  - Service model: Best effort, CBR, VBR, ABR, or UBR
  - Guarantees
    - Bandwidth: None, constant rate, guaranteed rate, guaranteed minimum
    - Loss: y/n
    - Order: y/n
    - Timing: y/n
  - Congestion feedback: y/n
  - Internet is: best effort, none, no, no, no

### 4.2. Virtual circuit vs. datagram networks

- Connection vs. connectionless service
  - Datagram networks: connectionless
  - Virtual-circuit networks: connection
  - Like TCP/UDP dichotomy connection/connectionless, but:
    - The service is host-to-host instead of process-to-process
    - You have no choice: you have to have one or the other
    - Implementation is in network core instead of transport layer

- Virtual circuits
  - Much like a physical telephone circuit, but virtual
  - Routers must maintain state for each connection
  - Each packet carries VC identifier, not destination host address

- VC forwarding tables
  - Complicated.
  - Tables contain:
    - Incoming interface, incoming VC #
    - Outgoing interface, outgoing VC #

- Signaling protocols
  - For setting up, maintaining, and tearing down virtual circuits
  - Used in ATM, frame-relay, X.25
  - Not used in today's internet.
  - e.g.
    - 1. initiate call
    - 2. incoming call, 3. accept call
    - 4. call connected, 5. data flow begins
    - 6. receive data
    - ... all in the Network layer!

- Datagram networks
  - Just have a forwarding table from destination address to link interfaces
  - Can't map every single IP. Instead, map IP ranges
  - For efficiency, use longest prefix matching

### 4.3. Inside a router

- Two key router functions:
  - Run routing algorithms
  - Forward datagrams from input to output links

- Input port:
  - Physical layer: Line termination
  - Link layer: Receive
  - Network layer: Lookup, forwarding, queueing.

- Switching fabric
  - Memory
    - Like a traditional computer.
    - Packed copied to memory, mutated by CPU, sent out through system bus.
  - Bus
    - Datagram goes straight from input port memory to output port memory.
    - Can have bus contention, where switching speed is limited by bus
      bandwidth.
  - Interconnection network
    - e.g. Banyan network, crossbar
    - Overcomes bus bandwidth limitations
    - e.g. Cisco 12000 can do 60 Gbps

- Output ports:
  - Network layer: Buffering
  - Link layer: Send
  - Physical layer: Line termination

- Output port buffering
  - RFC 3439: Average buffering = RTT * C
  - With N flows, buffering = RTT * C / sqrt(N)

- HOL blocking: Queued datagram at front of queue prevents others from moving
  forward, even if their output ports are free

<!-- 2018 Jun 8 -->

### 4.4. Internet protocol

- IP datagram format (32 bits per line):
  - ver; header len; type of service; length
  - 16-bit id; flags (incl. fragflag); fragment offset
  - ttl; upper layer; header checksum
  - source IP addr
  - dest IP addr
  - options... (optional)
  - data... (typically a TCP or UDP segment)

- Fragmentation, reassembly
  - MTU: Max transfer size
  - Large datagrams can be fragmented (divided into smaller ones)
  - They are reassembled at the final destination
  - Header bits are used to identify and order related fragments
    - Length is chopped up
    - ID stays the same
    - fragflag is 0 for last fragment, 1 for all others
    - offset is increased

- IP addressing
  - An IP address is associated with each interface, not each device! So
    routers can have multiple IPs
  - Subnet: Devices in the same subnet can physically reach each other without
    additional routers
  - CIDR: Classless interdomain routing
    - a.b.c.d/x: x is # of bits in subnet
  - Getting one:
    - Can be hard-coded
    - Can use DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

- DHCP
  - Four messages:  
    - Host broadcasts "DHCP discover" (optional)
    - DHCP server responds with "DHCP offer" (optional)
    - Host requests IP address with "DHCP request"
    - DHCP server sends address with "DHCP ack"
  - Can also return:
    - Address of first-hop router
    - Name and address of DNS server
    - Network mask
  - Layers so far: Phy; Eth; IP; UDP; DHCP

- ICANN: Internet corporation for assigned names and numbers
  - Allocates IP addresses to ISPs
  - Manages DNS
  - Resolves disputes

- NAT: Network address translation
  - Local network uses just one IP address facing the outside world
  - Controversial
    - Routers should only process up to layer 3
    - Violates end-to-end; P2P apps must take NAT into account
    - Should instead solve address shortage by IPv6
  - Incoming connections require one of:
    - Static port forwarding
    - UPnP IGD
    - Relaying (both NATted clients connect to relay)

- ICMP: Internet control message protocol
  - Error reporting, pings
  - Message consists of:
    - type
    - code + first 8 bytes of IP datagram causing error
  - Traceroute
    - Source sends series of UDP segments with TTL=1, 2, ...

- IPv6
  - Motivation: Need more addresses, better header format with no fragmentation
  - Datagram format:
    - ver; priority; flow label (concept of flow not well defined)
    - payload len; nex header; hop limit
    - source address
    - destination address
    - data...
  - Checksum removed
  - Options are outside of header, indicated by "next header" field
  - Brings with it ICMPv6
  - Tunneling: IPv6 datagram carried as payload in IPv4 datagram for
    compatibility

<!-- 2018 Jun 11 -->

### 4.5. Routing algorithms

- Graph abstraction
  - Can think of network as graph
  - Nodes are routers
  - Edges are links
  - Edges have costs
  - Goal: Find least-cost path betwen two nodes

- Routing algorithms
  - Some work with global information; others are decentralized
  - Some are static; others are dynamic (can update efficiently in response to
    changes)

- Link state algorithm
  - Link costs known to all nodes, via link state broadcast
  - e.g. Dijkstra's (priority-first search)
    - Each router is the root of a shortest-path tree, which determines its
      forwarding table
    - O(n log n)
    - Oscillations possible

- Distance vector algorithms
  - e.g. Bellman-Ford (try all intermediate nodes)
    - Bellman ford equation: if dx(y) = cost of least-cost path from x to y,
      then dx(y) = min over all v of c(x,v) + dv(y)
    - Dx(y) is esimate of dx(y)
  - Nodes send their own distance vector estimates to neighbors
  - Nodes receiving new distance estimates update their own distance estimates
  - Is iterative, asynchronous, distributed
  - When link cost changes, good news travels quickly but bad news travels slowly
  - Poisoned reverse: Nodes tell nodes that it forwards to not to go backward

- LS vs DV
  - Message complexity: LS sends O(nE) messages; DV exchanges messages between
    neighbors only
  - Speed of convergence: LS is O(n^2) algorithm requiring O(nE) messages and
    may have oscillations; DV has varying convergence time, permits routing
    loops, and may count to infinity
  - Robustness: LS nodes may advertise incorrect link costs; DV nodes may
    advertise incorrect path cost and errors propagate through the network

<!-- 2018 Jun 18 -->

- Exam will have more theoretical questions.
  - More TCP questions.
  - Longer exam, since we have more time.

- Hierarchical routing
  - LV and DV are both over-idealized, won't work at world scale
  - Have a hierarchy.
  - Autonomous System (AS): Region of routers
  - Routers in same AS run same routing protocol
  - Gateway router: At the edge of ASes, communicate with other ASes
  - Routers should know the gateways of their ASes

- Hot potato routing
  - Send packets to the closest of the two routers

- Intra-AS routing (aka interior gateway protocols)
  - RIP: Routing Information Protocol
    - 1982, BSD Unix
    - Uses Distance Vector algorithm
    - route-d: application that manages routing tables
  - OSPF: Open Shortest Path First
    - Publicly available algorithm
    - Advanced features:
      - Security (all messages authenticated)
      - Multiple paths
      - Multicast support
      - Can be hierarchical (with boundary routers, backbone routers)
  - IGRP: Interior Gateway Routing Protocol
    - Cisco proprietary

- Inter-AS routing
  - BGP: *the* de facto inter-domain routing protocol. The glue that holds the
    internet together.
  - eBGP: Subnet reachability from neighboring ASes
  - iBGP: Propagate reachability information to AS-internal routers
  - BGP session: When two BGP routers (peers) exchange BGP messages
    - Over semi-permanent TCP connections
    - iBGP within the same AS, eBGP between ASes
  - A "route" is a BGP prefix + BGP attributes
  - BGP attributes
    - AS-PATH: List of ASes through which prefix advertisemnt has passed
    - NEXT-HOP: The internal-AS router to use to get to the next-hop AS.
  - Import policy: Used by gateway routers to accept or decline routes
  - BGP route selection:
    - If a router knows more than one route to the destination AS, it selects a route based on
      - 1. Policy: Local preference value attribute
      - 2. Shortest AS-PATH
      - 3. Hot potato: Closest NEXT-HOP router
      - 4. Additional Criteria
  - BGP messages:
    - OPEN: Open TCP connection to peer, authenticate sender
    - UPDATE: Advertise new path, or withdraw old path
    - KEEPALIVE: Keeps connection alive and ACKs OPEN request
    - NOTIFICATION: Report errors in previous message; closes connection

- Putting it all together: How does an entry get into a router's forwarding
  table?
  - 1. Router becomes aware of prefix
    - From BGP routes in messages
  - 2. Router determines output port for prefix
  - 3. Router enters prefix-port in forwarding table

## 5. Link Layer

Taking notes per slide because I got rekt on the midterm and the prof seems to
like asking questions taken directly from the slides, as opposed to anything
like what was in the problem sets or past midterm.

- 1: -

- 2: -

- 3: -

- 4: The link layer is responsible for forming communication channels between
  adjacent nodes.

- 5: Transportation analogy

- 6,7: Link layer services:
  - Coordinates the sharing of a single network medium, with MAC addresses.
  - Reliable delivery
  - Flow control (pacing)
  - Error detection
  - Error correction
  - Half-duplex and full-duplex

- 8: Link layer is implemented in the Network Interface Card (NIC)

- 9: Example of adaptors communicating

- 10: -

- 11: EDC: Field for Error Detection and Correction bits. Cannot be 100%
  reliable.

- 12: Parity checking
  - Single bit parity (can be even (xor=0) or odd(xor=1)).
  - Two-dimensional bit parity: xor the rows AND the columns, and send both
    results.
    - Bottom-right-most bit is always zero, since it involves xoring each bit
      twice.

- 13: CRC: Cyclic redundancy check.
  - CRC is r bits long
  - Put r+1 bit pattern G (the "generator") on both the sender and receiver
  - CRC is satisfied if D concat R is divisible by G.

- 14: To compute CRC for a message, set R to 0 and long-divide D concat R by G.
  Then, R is simply the remainder.

- 23. Random access protocols
  - Nodes send data at full speed whenever they have it available.
  - Collisions are detected and recovered from.
  - Examples: Slotted ALOHA, ALOHA, CSMA, CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA

- 24. Slotted ALOHA
  - Equal-sized frames. Time divided into frame-sized time slots. Nodes are
    synchronized. If multiple nodes transmit in a slot, they all detect a
    collision. If there is a collision, colliding nodes retransmit with
    probability p until success.
  - Pros:

- 25. Pros/Cons of Slotted ALOHA
  - Pros:
    - With a single active node, you can continuously transmit at the channel's
      full rate
    - Highly decentralized
    - Simple
  - Cons:
    - With collisions, time slots are wasted
    - Idle time slots, if all nodes that need to transmit randomly don't
    - Nodes should be able to detect collision faster than it takes to send the
      whole packet
    - Needs clock synchronization

- 26. Slotted ALOHA efficiency
  - Efficiency: The long-term fraction of successful slots.
  - With N nodes of transmission probability p:
    - A given node has success p(1-p)^(N-1) in a slot, and
    - Chance of any node having success is Np(1-p)^(N-1).
    - Want to find p' that maximizes Np'(1-p')^(N-1).
  - As N goes to infinity, the best possible efficiency is 1/e = 0.37.

- 27. Pure ALOHA, i.e. Unslotted ALOHA
  - Same as Slotted ALOHA with no synchronization
  - Collision probability increases.

- 28. Pure ALOHA efficiency
  - Since nobody else can start transmitting in [t0-1,t0+1],
  - The probability a given node succeeds is
  - p×(1-p)^(N-1)×(1-p)^(N-1) = p×(1-p)^(2(N-1))
  - As N goes to infinity, the best possible efficiency is 1/(2e) = 0.18.

- 29. CSMA: Carrier Sense Multiple Access
  - Basic idea: Listen before you transmit, and don't interrupt others.
    - If channel seems idle, transmit entire frame.
    - If channel seems busy, wait.

- 30. CSMA collisions
  - Can still occur, due to propagation delay.
  - In that case, the entire packet transmission time is wasted.

- 31. CSMA/CD: CSMA with Collision Detection
  - If you detect a collision, stop transmitting.

- 32. CSMA/CD for Ethernet
  - 1. NIC gets datagram from Network Layer, creates frame
  - 2. Wait until channel is idle, then start transmitting.
  - 3. If entire frame is successfully transmitted, you're done
  - 4. If you detect another transmission, abort and send jam signal
  - 5. Then, enter binary exponential backoff:
    - After mth collision, randomly pick K from {0, ..., 2^m-1}.
    - Then, wait K×512 bit times and return to step 2.
    - Can have max limit on m and error if it is exceeded.

- 33. Diagram for the above

- 34. CSMA/CD details in reality
  - Medium sensing is done for 96 bit-times
  - Jamming signal is 48 bits. Is enough for collision detection.
  - Tp is 512 bit-times.
  - i saturates at 10.

- 35. Time diagram for CSMA/CD.

- 36. CSMA/CD efficiency
  - Efficiency = 1 / (1+5tprop/ttrans)
  - Where:
    - tprop = max prop delay between 2 nodes
    - ttrans = time to transmit max-size frame
  - So, efficiency goes to 1:
    - As tprop goes to 0, efficiency goes to 1
    - As ttrans goes to infinity, efficiency goes to 1
  - Pros:
    - Better performance than ALOHA, simple, cheap, and decentralized.

- EXAM: Don't need to know formulas. Need to know which is more efficient and
  why.

- 37. "Taking turns" MAC protocols
  - Recall:
    - Channel partitioning: efficient and fair at high load, inefficient at low load
    - Random access: efficient at low load, much collision overhead at high load
  - Taking turns protocols gives you the best of both worlds. ;)

- 38. Polling.
  - Master node invites slave nodes in turn to transmit.
  - No collisions, no empty slots.
  - Concerns are:
    - Polling overhead
    - Latency
    - Single point of failure

- 49. Routing to another LAN
  - DHCP is how routers assign you an IP address and a first-hop router.
  - TODO

- 50. Routing to another LAN (2)
  - LAST TERM FINAL: Question about routing 
  - The router decapsulates to get the IP payload and encapsulates to get 

- 51. Routing to another LAN (3)
  - Dm question: why do we differentiate between the link layer and network
    layer when it seems IP addresses could be used for everything MAC addresses
    are used for?
    - Ans: Cost. Switches are much cheaper and simpler than routers.

- 52-54. Routing to another LAN (4-6)

- 55. -

- 56. Ethernet.
  - Dominant technology for wired LAN.
  - NIC is just $20.
  - Cheaper and simpler than token LAN and ATM.
  - Fast and scalable; went from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps

- 57. Ethernet: physical topology
  - Bus: Popular through mid 90s. All nodes in same collision domain.
  - Switch: Prevails today. Each spoke runs a separate Ethernet protocol, so
    the arms of the star don't collide with each other.

- 58-59. Ethernet: frame structure
  - Preamble
    - 7 bytes of 10101010 followed by one byte of 10101011
    - Used to synchronize sender and receiver clocks
  - Destination MAC address
    - Ethernet adapter only keeps frames whose addresses matches its own (equal
      or broadcast)
  - Source MAC address
  - Type
    - Higher layer protocol (usually IP)
  - Data (payload)
  - CRC
    - Frames dropped if CRC detects an error

- 60. Ethernet properties
  - Connectionless: No handshaking
  - Unreliable: No ACKs or NAKs
    - Higher layer required for reliability
  - MAC protocol: Unslotted SCMA/CD with binary backoff.

- 61. 802.3 ethernet standards
  - They cover the Link and Physical layers
  - There are many of them!
  - They have a common MAC protocol and frame format, but
  - Different speeds: 2M, 10M, 100M, 1G, 10G (bps)
  - Different physical media: Fiber and cable

- 62. -

- 63. Switch
  - Link-layer device that takes an active role.
  - Stores-and-forwards Ethernet frames based on incoming frames' MAC
    addresses.
  - Transparent: Hosts don't know about the presence of switches.
  - Plug-and-play, self-learning: No configuration necessary!

- 64. Switch: Multiple simultaneous transmissions
  - Given A, A', B, B' are all connected to a switch, A-A' and B-B'
    transmission can happen simultaneously without collisions.

- 65. Switch forwarding table
  - A switch has a switch table containing:
    - MAC address of host
    - Interface to reach host
    - Time stamp

- 66. Switch: self-learning
  - The switch learns which hosts can be reached through which interfaces
  - When a frame is received, the switch "learns" the location of the sender
    and records it in its switch table

- 67. Switch: Frame filtering/forwarding pseudocode
  - 1. record incoming link, MAC of sending host
  - 2. index switch table using MAC destination address
  - 3. If found:
    - If destination on interface from which frame arrived, drop frame
    - Else forward frame on resulting interface
- - Else flood it! (forward on all interfaces except arriving interface)

- 68. Switch self-learning and forwarding example

- 69-70. Interconnected switches example

- 71. Institutional networks are often internally connected via a bunch of
      switches, with a router to the outside world

ADV HA hence TI, S-2-D R. Disadv. Large PT, need IPC

- 72. Switches vs. routers
  - Both are store-and-forward
    - Routers are network-layer
    - Switches are link-layer
  - Both have forwarding tables
    - Routers use routing algorithms and IP addresses
    - Switches use flooding to learn, and MAC addresses
  - Router pros:
    - Hierarchical addressing (isolates traffic)
    - Direct source-to-destination routing
  - Router cons:
    - Large processing time
    - Needs IP configuration
  - Switch pros:
    - Fast
    - Plug and play
  - Switch cons:
    - Broadcast storms can happen, especially if there is a switch loop
    - Large ARP table for large network
  - This looks like an EXAM question

- 73. VLAN motivation
  - Suppose a CS user moves office to EE, but wants to connect to their
    original CS switch.
  - Single broadcast domain. All layer-2 broadcast traffic must cross the
    entire LAN.

- 74. VLANs
  - Virtual local area network
  - Port-based VLAN: A switch's ports are grouped by software such that a
    single physical switch operates as multiple virtual switches

- 75. Port-based VLAN
  - Provides:
    - Traffic isolation
      - Can define based on MAC addresses or switch port
    - Dynamic membership
    - Forwarding between VLANs, done via routing
      - In practice, devices are combined switches-and-routers

- 76. VLANs spanning multiple switches
  - Trunk port: Connected to both switches, and carries frames between VLANs
    defined over multiple physical switches.
  - Protocol: 802.1q

- 77. 802.1q VLAN frame format
  - It just adds a Tag Control Information field

- 78. -

- 79. Multiprotocol label switching (MPLS)
  - Goal: High-speed IP forwarding, using a fixed length label
  - Fixed length identifier rather than longest prefix matching
  - Borrows ideas from Virtual Circuit, but still have IP addresses
  - It really shouldn't be called "multiprotocol", should be called
    "multilabel"

- 80. MPLS-capable routers
  - Don't inspect IP address for efficiency
  - Flexible: forwarding decisions can differ from those of IP
    - Can use destination and source addresses to route flows to the same
      destination differently (traffic engineering)
    - Can re-route flows quickly if link fails, e.g. with pre-computed backup
      paths (useful for VoIP)

- 81-82. MPLS vs. IP paths
  - IP: Next hop determined by destination alone
  - MPLS: Next hop determined by both source and destination

- 83. MPLS signaling
  - MPLS routers can modify the OSPF, IS-IS protocols to carry information used
    by MPLS routing
  - The entry MPLS router uses RSVP-TE (Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic
    Engineering) to set up MPLS forwarding at downstream routers

- 84. MPLS forwarding tables
  - Consist of: In label, out label, dest, out interface

- 85. -

- 86. Data center networks
  - 10k-100ks of hosts, closely coupled, in close proximity
  - Amazon YouTube Akamai Apple Microsoft Google, got that?
  - Challenges include:
    - Supporting multiple applications
    - Balancing load
    - Avoiding processing, networking, and data bottlenecks

- 87. Data center networks (2)
  - Use a tree, as usual
  - Layers, from top down:
    - Internet
    - Border router
    - Access router
    - Tier-1 switches <-> Load balancer
    - Tier-2 switches
    - TOR (top-of-rack) switches
    - Server racks (individual servers)
  - Advantages:
    - Can contain a cache
    - Attacks would first go through the load balancer if there is an attack,
      which means actual servers remain intact
  - Drawbacks:
    - Big points of failure
    - If switch A goes down, the server racks become isolated

- 88. Data center networks (3)
  - Use redundant connections
  - Tier 1 switches and Tier 2 switches may as well be a complete bipartite
    graph

- 89. -

- 90. A day in the life of a web request
  - Recall: Application, Transport, Network, Link

- 91. Diagram

- 92-97. A day in the life
  - 1. Your laptop uses DHCP/UDP/IP/Eth/Phy to get an IP address, as well as
       the IP addresses of the first-hop router and the DNS server
    - DHCP request: 
      - IP source: 0.0.0.0 (wildcard)
      - IP dest: 255.255.255.255 (broadcast)
      - MAC source: given by laptop's NIC
      - MAC dest: ff-ff-ff-ff-ff-ff (broadcast)
    - Ethernet frame broadcast on LAN is received by router running DHCP server
    - Switch learns the MAC address of the laptop
    - DHCP server returns a DHCP ACK
  - 2. ARP
    - Laptop uses DNS/UDP/IP/(ARP)/Eth/Phy to get the IP address of the DNS
      server.
  - TODO: rest of this

  - REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION ;) ;) ;)

<!-- 2018 Jul 23 -->

## Problems from Previous Final Exams

- Q2
  - a.) "What summary addresses would R1 forward to R2?" You can glue together
    172.1.4.0/24 through 172.1.7.0/24 since they share a prefix such that they
    go over all possible suffixes. So you can summarize them to 172.1.4.0/22.
    In the end, write that and 172.1.8.0/24.
  - b.) Can combine 172.1.8.0/24 and 172.1.9.0/24 into 172.1.8.0/23.
- Q4
  - i.) A: Wants traffic to W comes from B only, traffic to V from B or C. So
    advertise the AS-PATHs:
    - To B: AS-PATH: A W, A V
    - To C: AS-PATH: A V
  - ii.) C receives:
    - AV, Y, X, BX, BA, B
  - iii.) A should:
    - Discard any route advertisements that include X or Y in their AS-PATH
      attribute.
