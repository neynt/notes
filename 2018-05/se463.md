# SE 463: Software Requirements Specification and Analysis.

Professor: Joanne Atlee

## 2018 May 1

- I also taught PD 10.
- Course previously had a 120-page document on telephony; now it's focused on
  startups and consulting.
- Textbook: Software Requirements, 3ed.
- Other books: Running Lean, 2ed; Applying UML and Patterns, 3ed.
- Grading: 45% project, 5% professionalism, 50% final

- Successes vs. Flops; examples from Airbnb and Facebook
- Most projects fail because they don't meet the needs of their users, not
  because of bad design or code.

- Common problems:
  - Vague requirements
    - Example: our FYDP. Didn't even try to be precise.
  - Ambiguous requirements
    - An unsucessful attempt was made at precision.
  - Changing requirements
  - Insufficient user input
  - Incomplete requirements
  - Infeasible requirements
    - A technical person should be involved with the requirements to vet the
  - Wrong requirements

- Example: WaterlooWorks
  - Lots of complaints about performance, design
  - Whole ton of missing functionality

- Pain of bad requirements
  - Rework: time spent fixing problems rather than adding value
  - Requirements errors account for 70-85% of rework costs.

- Good requirements are very good for your whole project because a single error
  in requirements propagates down and becomes huge baddies in the
  implementation.

- Types of systems
  - Greenfield vs. brownfield: new product vs. enhancement.
  - Customer-driven vs. market-driven: one person vs. population
  - Web/mobile app vs. Enterprise vs. Infra vs. Safety-critical
  - In-house vs. outsourced

- The problem is to know what the problem is

- Webvan: Early internet startup.
  - Goal: Online grocery store with same-day delivery.
  - Time: Late 1990s.
  - Raised $1.2B to capture a piece of the $500B/yr grocery market
  - Planned to open in 26 cities at the same time
  - Began 1999, closed 2001.
  - Failure reasons:
    - Never found out if there was enough demand for online grocery shopping
    - Turns out people like to pick out their own meat, produce, prepared meals
  - Should have tested the idea out in smaller markets

- Lean Canvas
  - Problem
    - (Existing alternatives)
    - Solution
    - Key Metrics
  - Unique Value Proposition
    - (High-level concept)
    - Unfair Advantage
      - Hard to copy things.
      - NOT lower price, or easy to copy features.
    - Channels (paths to customers)
  - Customer Segments
    - (Early Adopters)
  - Cost Structure
  - Revenue Streams

- Airbnb example
  - Problems solved:
    - Unutilized space (for hosts)
    - A place, a cheap place, a local experience (for guests)
    - (Existing alternatives):
      - Hotels
      - Homeaway
    - Solutions:
      - Website, mobile app, and ratings/reviews
    - Metrics:
      - # new guests, repeat guests
      - # new hosts, repeat hosts
      - review scores
  - UVP: Guests experience what it's like to be a local
    - Unfair advantage:
      - Craigslist "integration"
      - Pro photographers
      - Insurance for hosts
    - Channels:
      - Social media
      - Word of mouth
      - Scraped contents of Craigslist
  - Customers: Tourists, students, hosts

- Charge from the start! Hard to switch to paid later on.

- Hypothesis testing
  - You want to test the guesses in your business model.
  - A hypothesis must be testable and falsifiable.
  - Parts of a hypothesis:
    - Dependent variable: the phenomenon of interest.
    - Independent variables: things that affect the dependent variable.
    - Testability: you should be able to find evidence for your hypothesis.
    - Falsifiability: you should be able to find evidence against your
      hypothesis.
  - Examples:
    - "There is another planet in the universe with life on it." (existence property)
    - "Students want to view job postings late at night because that is when the system has a fast response time."
      - Late at night? > After midnight
      - A fast response time? > 2 sec
      - "Forall" properties: "Most", "Significant Fraction"
  - Uncertainty: When multiple possibilities remain.

- Interviewing users.
  - 1. Welcome.
    - Thank you for taking the time.
    - We are trying to do this.
    - We wanted to see what people think.
    - This is how the interview will work.
    - Our product doesn't exist yet. We are not trying to sell anything.
  - 2. Collect demographics. "I'd like to learn a bit about you"
    - How do you use products like ours?
  - 3. Tell a story.
  - 4. Problem ranking.
  - 5. Explore customer's worldview.
  - 6. Wrapping up.
  - 7. Document results.

- Stakeholder
  - Very broad term; broader than you think
  - Includes the outside world (regulators, consultants, beneficiaries)
  - Negative stakeholder: People interested in failure of your project.
  - Champion stakeholder
    - The owner/client paying for the project to be developed.
    - Also: Ultimate stakeholder
  - Customer
    - Purchaser of software after it is developed.
    - Can be the client, the user, or neither
  - Users
    - Disfavored users: Should not have access for legal, security, safety reasons
    - Software agents and bots
  - Domain expert
    - Understand the problem your software is trying to solve
  - Software engineer
    - Technology expert
  - Other stakeholders
    - Inspectors
    - Market researchers
    - Lawyers
    - Industry standards

- Example: Facebook user classes
  - University students
  - Employers
  - Propagandists (Cambridge Analytica)
  - Corporate PR / branding / ads
  - Toddlers (disfavored)
  - Intelligence agencies
  - Terrorists / activists
  - News outlets
  - Non-user class / no account
  - Lurkers
  - Gamers (Farmville)
  - Old people
  - Politicians
  - Buyers and sellers of things
  - Friends

- Personas
  - For when real users are not available
  - Guard against tendency to build for self
  - Guard against the "elastic user": the "accommodate everyone user"
  - Can be made out of data ("data driven persona")

- User requirements
  - Use case: vertical slice of The Work.
  - Time-triggered use case: Activated when time passes.
  - Example: Patient monitoring system.
    - `[<<actor>> Sensors], [<<actor>> Nurse's station], [<<actor>> time]` all
      connected to `[Patient Monitoring System]`
