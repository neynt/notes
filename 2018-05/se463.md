# SE 463: Software Requirements Specification and Analysis.

Professor: Joanne Atlee

<!-- 2018 May 1 -->

- I also taught PD 10.
- Course previously had a 120-page document on telephony; now it's focused on
  startups and consulting.
- Textbook: Software Requirements, 3ed.
- Other books: Running Lean, 2ed; Applying UML and Patterns, 3ed.
- Grading: 45% project, 5% professionalism, 50% final

- Successes vs. Flops; examples from Airbnb and Facebook
- Most projects fail because they don't meet the needs of their users, not
  because of bad design or code.

- Common problems:
  - Vague requirements
    - Example: our FYDP. Didn't even try to be precise.
  - Ambiguous requirements
    - An unsucessful attempt was made at precision.
  - Changing requirements
  - Insufficient user input
  - Incomplete requirements
  - Infeasible requirements
    - A technical person should be involved with the requirements to vet the
  - Wrong requirements

- Example: WaterlooWorks
  - Lots of complaints about performance, design
  - Whole ton of missing functionality

- Pain of bad requirements
  - Rework: time spent fixing problems rather than adding value
  - Requirements errors account for 70-85% of rework costs.

- Good requirements are very good for your whole project because a single error
  in requirements propagates down and becomes huge baddies in the
  implementation.

- Types of systems
  - Greenfield vs. brownfield: new product vs. enhancement.
  - Customer-driven vs. market-driven: one person vs. population
  - Web/mobile app vs. Enterprise vs. Infra vs. Safety-critical
  - In-house vs. outsourced

- The problem is to know what the problem is

- Webvan: Early internet startup.
  - Goal: Online grocery store with same-day delivery.
  - Time: Late 1990s.
  - Raised $1.2B to capture a piece of the $500B/yr grocery market
  - Planned to open in 26 cities at the same time
  - Began 1999, closed 2001.
  - Failure reasons:
    - Never found out if there was enough demand for online grocery shopping
    - Turns out people like to pick out their own meat, produce, prepared meals
  - Should have tested the idea out in smaller markets

- Lean Canvas
  - Problem
    - (Existing alternatives)
    - Solution
    - Key Metrics
  - Unique Value Proposition
    - (High-level concept)
    - Unfair Advantage
      - Hard to copy things.
      - NOT lower price, or easy to copy features.
    - Channels (paths to customers)
  - Customer Segments
    - (Early Adopters)
  - Cost Structure
  - Revenue Streams

- Airbnb example
  - Problems solved:
    - Unutilized space (for hosts)
    - A place, a cheap place, a local experience (for guests)
    - (Existing alternatives):
      - Hotels
      - Homeaway
    - Solutions:
      - Website, mobile app, and ratings/reviews
    - Metrics:
      - # new guests, repeat guests
      - # new hosts, repeat hosts
      - review scores
  - UVP: Guests experience what it's like to be a local
    - Unfair advantage:
      - Craigslist "integration"
      - Pro photographers
      - Insurance for hosts
    - Channels:
      - Social media
      - Word of mouth
      - Scraped contents of Craigslist
  - Customers: Tourists, students, hosts

- Charge from the start! Hard to switch to paid later on.

- Hypothesis testing
  - You want to test the guesses in your business model.
  - A hypothesis must be testable and falsifiable.
  - Parts of a hypothesis:
    - Dependent variable: the phenomenon of interest.
    - Independent variables: things that affect the dependent variable.
    - Testability: you should be able to find evidence for your hypothesis.
    - Falsifiability: you should be able to find evidence against your
      hypothesis.
  - Examples:
    - "There is another planet in the universe with life on it." (existence
      property)
    - "Students want to view job postings late at night because that is when
      the system has a fast response time."
      - Late at night? > After midnight
      - A fast response time? > 2 sec
      - "Forall" properties: "Most", "Significant Fraction"
  - Uncertainty: When multiple possibilities remain.

- Interviewing users.
  - 1. Welcome.
    - Thank you for taking the time.
    - We are trying to do this.
    - We wanted to see what people think.
    - This is how the interview will work.
    - Our product doesn't exist yet. We are not trying to sell anything.
  - 2. Collect demographics. "I'd like to learn a bit about you"
    - How do you use products like ours?
  - 3. Tell a story.
  - 4. Problem ranking.
  - 5. Explore customer's worldview.
  - 6. Wrapping up.
  - 7. Document results.

<!-- 2018 May 10 -->

- Stakeholder
  - Very broad term; broader than you think
  - Includes the outside world (regulators, consultants, beneficiaries)
  - Negative stakeholder: People interested in failure of your project.
  - Champion stakeholder
    - The owner/client paying for the project to be developed.
    - Also: Ultimate stakeholder
  - Customer
    - Purchaser of software after it is developed.
    - Can be the client, the user, or neither
  - Users
    - Disfavored users: Should not have access for legal, security, safety
      reasons
    - Software agents and bots
  - Domain expert
    - Understand the problem your software is trying to solve
  - Software engineer
    - Technology expert
  - Other stakeholders
    - Inspectors
    - Market researchers
    - Lawyers
    - Industry standards

- Example: Facebook user classes
  - University students
  - Employers
  - Propagandists (Cambridge Analytica)
  - Corporate PR / branding / ads
  - Toddlers (disfavored)
  - Intelligence agencies
  - Terrorists / activists
  - News outlets
  - Non-user class / no account
  - Lurkers
  - Gamers (Farmville)
  - Old people
  - Politicians
  - Buyers and sellers of things
  - Friends

- Personas
  - For when real users are not available
  - Guard against tendency to build for self
  - Guard against the "elastic user": the "accommodate everyone user"
  - Can be made out of data ("data driven persona")

- User requirements
  - Use case: vertical slice of The Work.
  - Time-triggered use case: Activated when time passes.
  - Example: Patient monitoring system.
    - `[<<actor>> Sensors], [<<actor>> Nurse's station], [<<actor>> time]` all
      connected to `[Patient Monitoring System]`

<!-- 2018 May 15 -->

- Actor generalization
  - It's like actor inheritance
- «include»: "sub" use case used within multiple other use cases
  - often overused
- «extend»: "sub" use case that extends or replaces part of an existing use
  case
  - used in "brownfield" projects (highlight new functionality)
- Use-case description: Textual format. Sequence of actions taken by actors and
  systems.
- User stories: Description of what a user wants to be able to do.
- Three Cs of user stories:
  - Card: As a ROLE, I want SOMETHING so that BENEFIT IS ACHIEVED.
  - Conversation: Discussion 
  - Confirmations: Objective criteria for checking whether the implementation
    meets the requirements.

- Changing requirements
  - 1. Requirements baseline
  - 2. Unique value proposition
  - 3. Project scope

## Guest lecture by migod.

- Du vs. Sie in German.
- English is a Germanic language.
- Workflow models
  - A workflow is a sequence of tasks
- Scenario
  - One full execution path through a use case, listing only observable actions

<!-- 2018 May 24 -->

## Guest lecture by shyamsheth.

- Worked at Fixmo; was cool.
- Geoffrey Moore
- Steve Blank: The Startup Owner's Manual

## Stakeholder Analysis: Is not an academic exercise.

- Often, stakeholders were:
  - Too broad/vague
  - Unreachable (govt regulators, companies)
  - Cannot depend solely on proxies

- Potential proxies:
  - Lawyers
  - Inspectors
  - Food safety regulators
  - Alcohol regulators
  - Industry standards

- Must have proxies:
  - Corrupt politicians
  - Trolls

- Interviewees:
  - Don't tell them it's school busywork
  - IRL, want some separation between yourself and interviewee

- You can do this! Treat it like science.
  - Use your technical network, peers
  - Meetup groups
  - Coffee shops and malls
  - Standing in line, waiting for bus
  - Facebook groups, Craigslist
  - Use your student status

<!-- 2018 May 29 -->

## 8. Elicitation

- Artifact-based
  - Learn by studying docs, systems, artifacts before asking for stakeholders'
    time.
- Stakeholder-based
  - Learn problem-specific, stakeholder-specific details
  - Examples: Stakeholder analysis, questionnaires, interviews, observation,
    task demo, ask suppliers, domain workshop, personas
  - Interviews: Useful for learning
  - Apprenticeship: Master v. Apprentice. Disney's Fantasia.
- Model-based
  - Examples: Modelling, analysis patterns, mockups and prototyping, pilot
    experiments
- Creativity-based
  - Examples: Systemic thinking, brainstorming, creativity workshop, constraint
    relaxation
  - Differs from the others in that the requirements come from yourself, rather
    than outside. Violates the motto, "deliver what the customer wants".
  - Give them what they didn't know they wanted.
  - Innovation: Our job is to give the client, on time and on cost, not what
    they want, but what they never dreamed they wanted; and when they get it,
    they recognize it as something that they wanted all the time.
    - The less you know, the easier it is to come up with new things.
    - Ignorance is extremely important in requirements engineering.
    - DM Berry "the importance of ignorance in requirements engineering" --
      most cited paper.
  - Diverge-converge:
    - Preparation (diverge)
    - Incubation (diverge)
    - Illumination (diverge and converge)
    - Verification (converge)
  - Creativity workshops:
    - The synergy is n(n-1)/2. Quadratic.

<!-- 2018 May 31 -->

## 9. Domain Models

- Dan Berry again
- Half of today will not be on the slides.

- UML: Unusual, undefinable modeling language

- Domain model contains:
  - Real-world entities
  - Relationships between them
  - Subject matter for which we're creating a solution
  - Constraints, environmental assumptions

- Domain model
  - Expressed with UML class diagrams
  - Omit details early on.
    - Start with class name
    - Then add attributes, associations, roles
    - Then maybe types, params, initVals
    - NO operations
    - NO language data types, public, private, static, derived

- Example: airline domain model from web
- Example: migod's java code analyzer

- How to tell what is in the domain model, and what is not.
  - (not in the slides)
  - Take the subset of the universe that affects, and that is affected by, the
    system. Focus on that.

- Traffic light example
  - D: Drivers behave legally, cars function correctly
  - S: Spec of traffic light. Guarantees that perpendicular directions do not
    show green at the same time.
  - R: Perpendicular traffic does not collide.

## Guest lecture: Robyn Lutz

- Robyn Lutz, Iowa State University

- Requirements engineering for a molecular programmed nanosystem
- TEZE: Requirements engineers will rule in the near future.

- Molecular programming
  - Creates synthetic nanosystems that aseemble themselves from molecular
    components.
  - Can be done by carefully choosing the molecular strands and concentrations.

- Example: programmable bio-sensor
  - "Pliers" that go from open to shut when a specific target module is present

- 2009: Box with controllable lid (Andersen et al, Nature)
- 2011: Molecular calculation of square root of 4-bit numbers (Qian and Winfree)
- 2011: Simulate digital signals (Qian and Winfree)

- How to do this:
  - Agree on intent (requirements)
  - Do detailed design using software tools
  - Compile into DNA strands
  - Order strands online
  - Implement system in lab (prepare, mix, heat, cool)
  - Test/observe results
  - Debug and repeat

- Safety-critical applications:
  - Medical
  - Biosensors
  - Drug delivery
  - Picture: DNA nanorobot, with atomic force microscope

- Applying requirements engineering
  - Problem: Hard to monitor when an event occurs (or doesn't occur!) in a DNA
    nanosystem
  - Solution: Use a molecular watchdog timer

- Why use requirements engineering
  - To make things right.

- Debugging the requirements
  - False positive risk? Yes.
  - Likely and critical: Dog barking too much will flood the system with alarm
    molecules

- Probabilistic model checking
  - PRISM
  - STOCHASTIC MODEL CHECKER

- LAMP: Laboratory for Molecular Programming at ISU

## 10. Prototyping

- Presentation prototypes
- Exploratory prototypes
- Breadboards or experimental prototypes
- Evolutionary prototypes

### SPRINT rules

- 1. The Facilitator is in charge of the schedule.
- 2. The Decider makes all tough decisions.
- 3. No devices in the room.
- Monday: Map.
  - Make a map of the workflow as it exists.
  - Rephrase problems as opportunities
  - Pick a target
- Tuesday: Sketch.
  - Group brainstorms don't work. Sketch alone.
  - Sketches typically simple on sticky notes.
- Wednesday: Decide.
  - Fast decisions
  - No groupthink
  - No sales pitches
  - Turn winning sketches into storyboard
- Thursday: Prototype.
  - Make a realistic facade with Powerpoint or something.
  - Mock out services with actors.
- Friday: Test.
  - Five interviews are enough to reveal big patterns.
  - Fix shit
  - Subsequent consecutive sprints are faster

### Examples

- Flatiron Health example

- Savioke Labs example
  - Hotel robots
  - Fast Company article "How Savioke Built a Robot Personality in 5 Days"

- Slack example
  - How to explain Slack to non-techies?

- Crazy Eights
  - Everyone spends five minutes to create six screens

- F-Layout design
  - Eye scanning pattern

## 11. Quality requirements

- What would you look for when buying a new car?
  - HP, engine reviews, price, style, brand recognition, fuel efficiency, size,
    insurance rates
- These are all quality requirements.

- WHEREAS, functional requirements are
  - what the software is supposed to do
  - are either satisfied or not

- Quality requirements
  - describe additional constraints that measure the quality of a solution
  - are often, but not necessarily, but preferably, quantitative

- Car functional requirements:
  - Airbags, active safety features, cup holders, move people over a distance,
    AWD

- Examples of quality requirements:
  - Performance
  - Reliability (no problems with software)
  - Robustness (no problems if input has problems)
  - Adaptability
  - Security
  - Usability
  - Scalability
  - Efficiency
  - Accuracy, precision

- Other nonfunctional requirements:
  - Design constraints
  - Operating constraints
  - Product-family requirements
  - TODO

- Motherhood requirements:
  - Requirements that people obviously want, so no need to ask
  - What's important is relative importance.
  - "reliable", "user-friendly", "maintainable"

- Fit criteria:
  - Criteria that quantify the extent to which a quality requirement must be
    met.
  - Examples:
    - No more than 5 minutes of downtime a year.
    - 75% of users judge the system as usable.
    - After training, 90% of users can process new account within 4 minutes
  - Some can't be tested before delivery. Must measure indirectly.

- Monte carlo techniques: Estimate unknown using known quantity by lots of
  random simulation

- Paper airplane exercise:
  - Degrades slowly with use -> Usable more than once.
  - Flight time. - 15s
  - Predictable flight path. -> Same pattern when thrown every time.
  - Goes fast. -> 5m/s
  - Looks cool. -> 50% of users recommend looking at it
  - Not expensive. -> Less than $1

- Many quality attributes typically conflict.
  - e.g. Efficiency neg Interopability
  - e.g. Reliability pos Availability

- Rich fit criteria
  - Range of satisfaction
  - Example:
    - Requirement,   Outstanding, Target, Minimum
    - Response time, 0.1s,        0.5s,   1s
    - CPU util,      20%,         25%,    30%
    - Usability,     40 tasks/hr, 30,     20
  - Value to user in terms of quality attributes is a sigmoid curve.
    Diminishing returns are a thing.

<!-- 2018 Jun 14 -->

## 12. Prioritizing requirements

- Descoping
  - Rapid descoping phase: quickly reducing the scope of a project, usually to
    meet a release date

- Priority
  - Can be: relative importance
  - Can be: precedence, ordering

- Prioritization criteria
  - Examples:
    - Business value added
    - Penalty/harm avoided
    - Risk
    - Cost
    - Time
  - Can prioritize according to cost-value ratios

- Grouping requirements
  - By priority: Critical, Standard, Optional
  - Problem: Stakeholders will say that everything is critical. (typically,
    85%)

- Ranking requirements
  - Can totally order your requirements, but it's hard to see relative
    differences this way.

- 100 dollar test (aka: cumulative voting)
  - Stakeholders are given 100 prioritization points to distribute among the
    requirements.
  - Total dollar amount gives you an idea of relative importance.

- Kano model
  - Graph of satisfaction as a function of execution quality.
  - y=x: Performance. Requirements the customer specifically asked for.
  - Sell put payoff: Basic. Requirements the customer takes for granted.
  - Buy call payoff: Excitement. Delightful features the customer does not
    request or expect.
  - y=0: Indifferent. Requirements the customer does not care about.

- Kano surveys
  - "How would you feel if the requirement were included?" (Functional)
  - "How would you feel if the requirement were NOT included?" (Dysfunctional)
  - Answers:
    - I like it
    - I expect it
    - I am neutral
    - I can tolerate it
    - I dislike it
  - Table from answers to basic/performance/excitement/indifferent.
    - Other possibilities: questionable, reverse.
  - Implement Basic first, then Performance, then Excitement, then Indifferent.
  - Example: MathNEWS interactive

- Categorization plane
  - To combine multiple surveys, use values of -2, -1, 0, 2, and 4. Then
    categorize using the quadrants of [0,4]².

- Analytic Hierarchy Process
  - Analyzes stakeholders' pairwise comparisons of requirements.
  - Scores: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
    - 1: equal value, 9: extremely preferred
    - Use even numbers when you need compromise
  - At row Req1 and col Req2 of a matrix, put score of how much Req1 is
    preferred over Req2. If inverse, then use 1/score.
  - Estimate eigenvalues by normalizing columns, sum the rows, then normalize
    overall
  - Can check consistency by:
    - 1. Multiply comparison matrix with priority vector
    - 2. Pointwise divide result by priority vector
    - 3. Take average to get principle eigenvalue
    - 4. Compute consistency index CI = (4.37 - n)/(n-1)
    - 5. CR = CI/0.90. Want CR < 0.10.

- Combining different techniques
  - Plot ROI ratio on a common graph

<!-- 2018 Jun 19 -->

## 13. Risk management

- Risk: Potential for loss

- Risk exposure: criticality(risk) = likelihood(risk) * consequences(risk)

- Risk consequence table
  - Horizontal axis: Risks and likelihoods.
  - Vertical axis: Requirements and weights.
  - Middle: Estimate of impact of risk on requirement (0.0-1.0)
  - Bottom: Total risk criticality.
  - Right: Loss of objective.

- Risk countermeasures table
  - Horizontal axis: Risks and likelihoods.
  - Vertical axis: Countermeasures.
  - Middle: Estimate of reduction on risk.
  - Bottom: Combined risk reduction.
  - Right: Overall single effect of countermeasure.

- Formulas
  - criticality = likelihood * consequences
  - consequences = sum over reqs of impact(req, risk) * weight(req)
  - tall poles - highest criticality
  - loss(req) = sum over risks of impact(req, risk) * likelihood(risk) * weight(req)

<!-- 2018 Jun 21 -->

## 14. Specifications

- Overview of module
  - Deriving specs from reqs
  - Spec, Dom ⊧ Req
  - Domain model for specs

- Example: Lufthansa Flight DLH 2904
  - Req: Reverse thrust enabled iff aircraft is moving on the runway
  - -> System Spec: reverse thrust enabled iff wheel pulses are detected
  - Assumptions made:
    - 1. Aircraft is moving on the runway iff wheels are turning
    - 2. Wheel sensor detects pulses iff wheels are turning
  - Assumption 1 didn't hold; wheels hydroplaned

- Environment v. System model
  - (Environment [Interface) System]
  - Environment contains requirements
  - Specification is fully about the interface

- Assumptions
  - Ideally, we want to show that the specifications imply the requirements:
  - Spec ⊧ Req
  - Often, we cannot do so without making some assumptions about the environment.
  - Dom subseteq Env

- Example: Park User Fees
  - Reqs:
    - R1: Collect $1 fee from each user on entry to the park.
      - Interface: Coin slot
      - Spec:
        - (Env) coin inserted into slot
        - (Sys) senses coin
    - R2: Ensure that anyone who has paid may enter the park.
      - Interface: Turnstile
      - Spec:
        - (Sys) unlock turnstile upon sensing a new coin
        - (Env) visitor pushes unlocked turnstile
    - R3: Ensure that no one may enter park without paying.
      - Interface: Turnstile
      - Spec:
        - (Sys) detect entry
        - (Env) relock turnstile
  - Assumptions:
    - Dom
      - (1) Coins are $1
      - (2) Person who paid is the person who enters
      - (3) Only 1 person enters when the gate is nocked
    - Spec
      - (1-2) Coin slot accepts $1 and opens gate
      - (*) After 1 entry, gate is relocked
    - Req
      - (1) Gate, fence, coin slot
      - (2) Honour system, collection box
      - (3) Manned kiosk

- Example: Thermostat
  - R: Want to keep the air temperature at or above the user-defined temperature.
  - Interface devices:
    - Thermometer
    - UI for user to set
    - AC, furnace
  - Spec:
    - If UI-set temp > thermometer temp then turn on AC
  - Assumption:
    - AC on cools the air temperature

- Example: Elevator

- Deliverable
  - A Scenario is a path through the activity diagram
  - Classic mistake:
    - Writing assumption that really reflects a responsibility of the system

- Domain models
  - Diagrams that capture requirements and specifications
  - Requirements only captures environment
  - Specifications also includes «interface»s and parts of the system

- Domain models should have:
  - Attributes
  - **Multiplicities on all associations**
  - Association names, role names
  - Qualifiers to simplify multiplicities on associations
  - Actors, as stick figures or «actor» classes
  - For specifications: Interface devices as «interface» classes

- Domain models should not have:
  - Class-level operations, methods
  - Visibility annotations (private, protected, public)
  - Navigability arrows
  - Attributes types, initial values (unless needed for model correctness)
  - Object construction and destruction functions

- Thank you for coming on a day you have a midterm
- Tuesday: OCL (Object Constraint Language)
